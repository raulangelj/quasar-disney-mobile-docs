# New Contributor Onboarding

This guide is for a new human or agent contributor joining an existing, initialized
Throughstone project. It gives the contributor's first end-to-end path: assemble the
workspace, read the project state from disk, and start their first contribution STEP without
guessing.

This is not the first project bootstrap. The first maintainer ran `./init.sh` from the
Throughstone scaffold to create the project. Later contributors use the generated project
workspace and, for multi-repo projects, `Code/<project>-docs/scripts/setup-workspace.sh`.

## 1. Identify the project shape

Most Throughstone projects are **multi-repo**:

- The workspace root is a per-machine shell, not a repo.
- The docs hub lives at `Code/<project>-docs/`.
- The prompt/history repo lives at `prompts/`.
- Code repos live as siblings under `Code/<project>-*`.

Some early projects are **mono-repo-for-now**:

- There is one repo.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `doctor.sh` are committed in that repo.
- `setup-workspace.sh` is not needed. Clone the repo, open it, and continue at
  [Read the project state](#4-read-the-project-state).

## 2. Set up a multi-repo workspace

Create or choose the workspace root, then clone the docs hub into the expected location:

```sh
git clone <docs-repo-url> Code/<project>-docs
```

From the workspace root, run the generated setup helper:

```sh
Code/<project>-docs/scripts/setup-workspace.sh
```

The helper clones sibling repos listed in `Code/<project>-docs/registries/repos.yml` when
they have remotes, then writes the per-machine root files. Verify these exist at the
workspace root:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `doctor.sh`

If a sibling repo has no remote in `registries/repos.yml`, `setup-workspace.sh` cannot clone
it. Read its registry entry and ask the maintainer how that repo is provided.

## 3. Create your local user profile

Before reading or running project sessions, create root `.throughstone/local-user.md`. If it
already exists on this machine, confirm it belongs to the active user; otherwise replace it
with this user's answers. This file is personal local state, not project documentation and
not something to commit. If an agent is guiding onboarding, this is its first user-facing
step for every second-or-later contributor. Ask the active user:

1. How much experience do you have building a software project like this? Level **1** (no
   coding experience), **2** (basic coding experience), or **3** (senior developer or above).
2. How terse or explanatory should project discussions be by default? **Terse**,
   **Normal**, or **Explanatory**.

Record the answers as **Experience level** and **Communication style**. Agents use this file
to calibrate explanations and questions for this contributor; they should not inherit another
person's preferences from project docs. An explicit style request in chat overrides this file
for the current session only; edit the file to change future defaults.

Use this shape:

```md
# Local User Profile

Experience level: {{1 | 2 | 3}} - {{label}}
Communication style: {{Terse | Normal | Explanatory}}
```

## 4. Read the project state

Start with these files, in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md` - agent and contributor operating context, including kickoff versus resume.
2. `Code/<project>-docs/METHOD.md` - the method, read once before working.
3. `Code/<project>-docs/overview.md` - project brief and bootstrap status marker.
4. `prompts/STEP-index.md` - roadmap, STEP status, owners, and repo projections.
5. `Code/<project>-docs/registries/repos.yml` - canonical repo inventory.

Then run the local checks from the workspace root:

```sh
./doctor.sh status
./doctor.sh check
./doctor.sh links
```

Use `./doctor.sh status` as the source of the next action. It reads the project state from
disk and applies the next-action resolver from `METHOD.md`. Confirm its result against
`prompts/STEP-index.md`, and if a STEP is already in progress, read its PLAN in
`Upcoming Prompts/`.

## 5. Start your first contribution STEP

Before editing code or durable docs:

1. Read the README for every repo you expect to touch. The repo README is the local setup and
   "about" document for that repo.
2. Read `prompts/STEP-index.md` and select the next appropriate STEP. If you are adding an
   ad-hoc STEP, reserve a number according to `Code/<project>-docs/runbooks/collaboration.md`.
3. Check the selected STEP's `Repos (projection)` against other in-flight rows. If there is
   overlap, call it out before proceeding.
4. Create a branch named `step-NNNN-short-name`. Use the same branch name in every repo the
   STEP touches.
5. Update only your STEP row in `prompts/STEP-index.md` to `In progress` when you start, and
   push that small status change to the shared trunk.
6. After the STEP PLAN is approved, work from it by running the lowest open substep first.
7. Edit shared tables narrowly: your own STEP row, your own ADR/registry row, or the row the
   STEP explicitly owns. Do not re-sort or reformat shared tables as drive-by cleanup.
8. When complete, update the STEP review state, archive the PLAN and substep prompts from
   `Upcoming Prompts/` into the appropriate `prompts/<phase>/step-NNNN/` folder, and mark the
   STEP `Done` in `prompts/STEP-index.md`.

For team and concurrency details, read
[`runbooks/collaboration.md`](runbooks/collaboration.md). That runbook owns the full rules
for reserving STEP numbers, branch naming, shared-file edits, ADR numbering, overlap
warnings, and push races.

## 6. Keep paths straight

This scaffold stores the template at `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/ONBOARDING.md`. In an
initialized project, the generated docs hub path is `Code/<project>-docs/ONBOARDING.md`.
When editing template files, keep the literal `quasar-disney-mobile` placeholder. When instructing
contributors in generated projects, use `Code/<project>-docs`.

# Updating Throughstone

Use this when you want to compare a bootstrapped project against a newer Throughstone
template release and decide whether to bring over scaffold improvements.

Trigger phrases:
- "check for Throughstone updates"
- "update the scaffold"
- "compare this project to the latest Throughstone template"

This is **scaffold/method maintenance**, not a created-project runbook. Runbooks cover the
project you are building; this file covers the Throughstone machinery copied into that
project. If an update changes method rules, agent behavior, collaboration rules, CI, or
multiple repos, turn it into a tracked STEP before applying it.

## 1. Principles

- **Default to advisory.** The first action is always a report, not a write.
- **Do not treat unchanged-local as safe.** It only means the file can be replaced without a
  text merge; the behavioral risk may still be high.
- **Project state is protected.** Never automatically update architecture docs, ADRs,
  project overview, STEP history, application code, or stamped/generated repo files.
- **The updater is stateless.** If updater tooling exists, project state lives in a manifest
  in the docs hub; update logic may change upstream, but it must read state from disk.
- **Do not run surprise remote code.** Manual comparison does not require signatures or
  checksums. If future tooling executes downloaded updater code, pin the release/ref and verify
  it using the provenance mechanism that release publishes.
- **Make rollback boring.** Apply updates only when every affected repo has a clean working
  tree and index, use the branch required by this guide, and keep the report with the change.

## 2. File Buckets

| Bucket | Examples | Update policy |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Tools / scripts** | `scripts/status.sh`, `scripts/check.sh`, `scripts/setup-workspace.sh` | Review required. May be replaced when local still matches the installed baseline, but still report behavioral implications. |
| **Process docs** | `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`, `prompts/README.md`, `runbooks/*.md`, `coding-standards/*.md` | Review required. Changes may alter how contributors or agents work. Apply as a coherent group when files reference each other. |
| **Templates for future use** | `templates/*.md`, `templates/architecture-sessions/*.md`, `templates/ci/*.yml` | Future-only by default. Updating them affects newly generated docs/sessions/repos; it does not rewrite existing generated outputs. |
| **Stamped/generated files** | repo `README.md`, copied CI workflows, `.env.example`, STEP plans | Project-owned after creation. Never auto-update; provide advisory diffs only if explicitly requested. |
| **Project state** | `overview.md`, `architecture/`, `adr/`, `prompts/STEP-index.md`, `prompts/<phase>/`, application code repos | Never auto-update from upstream Throughstone. Changes happen through the normal method: sessions, ADRs, STEPs, and check-ins. |

`prompts/README.md` is the exception inside `prompts/`: it is scaffold/process guidance for
future STEP authoring, not project history. Review it like other process docs. The STEP index,
phase folders, archived PLANs, and archived substep prompts remain protected project state.

### Legacy local user profile fields

Older Throughstone projects stored the first user's communication preferences in
`overview.md` under **Your experience level** and **Planning communication style**. Newer
projects store those personal preferences in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, because each
contributor has their own local profile.

When reviewing or applying this migration, compare the related files as a coherent group. It is
not just a `METHOD.md` change:

- `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` defines the two local-profile questions and file shape.
- `AGENTS.md`, `METHOD.md`, and `ONBOARDING.md` define when agents and additional contributors
  create or read the local profile.
- `scripts/check.sh` reports legacy `overview.md` preference sections.
- `templates/overview-template.md`, `templates/planning-session.md`,
  `templates/step-plan-template.md`, `templates/substep-prompt-template.md`, and
  `templates/architecture-sessions/*.md` keep future sessions from reading project-level
  preference fields.
- `prompts/README.md` carries the STEP-planning communication-style behavior.
- `runbooks/collaboration.md` explains the multi-contributor local-profile expectation.

During an update, treat those old `overview.md` sections as legacy project-state drift:

1. Create or update root `.throughstone/local-user.md` for the active user, optionally using
   the old `overview.md` values as a starting point if they actually describe that user.
2. Remove the old personal-preference sections from `overview.md` only after confirming they
   are not project facts.
3. Do **not** migrate them automatically in updater tooling or `doctor`: in a team, the old
   values may describe the original maintainer, not the active contributor.

`scripts/check.sh` warns when it sees these legacy sections. The warning is advisory and does
not fail the check.

### 1.7 migration

**Upgrading from 1.6? Start here.** This release rewrites no project files. Only two defaults
shift, and only once you pull the new tooling/templates: the doc-maturity ladder and the check-in
cadence. Fast path:

1. Pull the process docs + tooling as one review-required group (`METHOD.md`,
   `runbooks/check-in.md`, `templates/planning-session.md`, `scripts/status.sh`, `scripts/check.sh`).
2. Want the old check-in window (DUE 10 / OVERDUE 20)? Add `<!-- CHECK-IN-CADENCE: 15 -->` to
   `overview.md`; otherwise omit it to take the new default of 20 (DUE 15 / OVERDUE 25).
3. Optionally reinterpret old `Status: MVP` / `Status: Stable` architecture docs as
   `Status: Current` (no forced change; `check.sh` keeps passing either way).
4. Create `inputs/` and copy its `README.md` if you want the bring-your-own-docs drop point.
5. Everything else is future-only or purely behavioral — the per-area detail below covers each.

The **1.7 base refactors** generalize the method — flexible Phase-1 naming, decoupled
doc metadata, a deferred-coverage check-in sweep, a recorded release stage, and existence-aware
repo scaffolding — so it also fits later phases, re-runs, custom conventions, and existing
codebases. Overall this is **low-friction: nothing is auto-rewritten**, and the §2 file-bucket
rules apply unchanged.
There are **two opt-outable default shifts** (the doc-maturity ladder and the check-in cadence);
apply each area as a coherent review-required group, as with the legacy migration above.

**Doc metadata & maturity ladder.**

- *Templates for future use* (`templates/architecture-doc-template.md`): new architecture docs get
  the `Draft → Current → Deprecated` comment and the optional `Coverage:` field; existing generated
  docs are not rewritten.
- *Process docs* (`METHOD.md` §6, `runbooks/check-in.md`): adopt the new Version / Status / Coverage
  semantics and the "check-in skips `Status: Deprecated`" rule.
- *Project state* (existing `architecture/*.md`): never auto-updated. A doc still carrying
  `Status: MVP` or `Status: Stable` keeps passing `check.sh` (it validates the field's presence,
  not its value), but those rungs are retired. Recommended one-time, manual reinterpretation:
  `Status: MVP → Current`, `Status: Stable → Current`. Adopt `Deprecated` / `Coverage` where useful.
  No forced change.

**Deferred-coverage check-in sweep.**

- *Process docs* (`runbooks/check-in.md`): the periodic check-in gains a deferred-coverage sweep. It
  reads the `Coverage:` field above, so it only acts on docs marked `Coverage: deferred`; a project
  that never defers coverage sees no change. No `status.sh` change.
- *Project state* (existing `architecture/*.md`): never auto-updated. If a doc carries
  `Coverage: deferred`, the next check-in surfaces it with a disposition (backfill / still defer /
  seed a `Planned` STEP + `risks.yml` risk); a `Status: Deprecated` deferred doc is listed as
  retired, never backfilled.

**Flexible Phase-1 naming.**

- *Templates for future use* (`templates/step-index-seed.md`, `templates/step-plan-template.md`,
  `templates/phase-readme-template.md`, `templates/architecture-sessions/02-phasing-roadmap.md`,
  `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md`): new projects get the `{{PHASE_1_NAME}}` heading placeholder, the kickoff
  milestone-kind question, and the milestone-general wording; existing generated files are not
  rewritten.
- *Process docs* (`METHOD.md` §1, `templates/architecture-sessions/14-cross-cutting-review.md`,
  `runbooks/collaboration.md`, `prompts/README.md`): adopt the create-at-archive convention — the
  Phase-1 folder is created from the `## Phase 1 — <name>` heading when STEP-1 is archived, not
  shipped pre-named — and the reworded "Phase-1 shortcut" foreclosure phrase (also in
  `templates/architecture-sessions/05-scaling-performance.md`).
- *Project state* (an existing project's `prompts/001-mvp/` folder and its `## Phase 1 — MVP`
  heading): never auto-updated. A project already on `001-mvp/` keeps it — the archive folder that
  exists is the one STEP-1 landed in, and nothing renames it. New phases (Phase 2+) already create
  their own folders. No forced change; `status.sh` / `check.sh` are unaffected (they key on index
  rows, not folder names).

**Release stage as a recorded fact.**

- *Templates for future use* (`templates/overview-template.md`, `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md`): new projects
  get the optional **Release stage / launch target** line and a Stage-1 kickoff question (leading
  with a pre-launch default); existing generated `overview.md` files are not rewritten.
- *Process docs* (`METHOD.md` §4, `templates/architecture-sessions/03`, `04`, `05`, `06`, `07`, `08`,
  `09`, `10`, `conditional-identity-auth.md`, `conditional-privacy-compliance.md`,
  `registries/risks.yml`): sessions now calibrate their *breadth* defaults (how big / how public) to
  the recorded release stage + load, and their *rigor* (security, privacy, availability) to blast
  radius / data sensitivity — replacing the old "for an MVP" shorthand. The decisions reached and
  docs produced are unchanged; only the framing moves off an assumed "MVP."
- *Project state* (an existing project's `overview.md`): never auto-updated. Add the optional Release
  stage line if it's useful — nothing requires it, and `check.sh` never reads it. The release stage
  stays independent of the Phase-1 scope name and of doc `Status`; the three axes don't collide.

**Existence-aware repo scaffolding.**

- *Process docs* (`templates/planning-session.md`): the implementation planning session's
  repo-scaffolding work-item now scaffolds a repo only if it isn't already registered in
  `registries/repos.yml` with a filled-in README; an already-registered repo is left in place, not
  re-created. Adopt the reworded work-item. No `status.sh` / `check.sh` change.
- *Project state* (existing `registries/repos.yml` and existing repos): never auto-updated. Nothing is
  rewritten. The change is behavioral — a planning re-run (or a planning pass over a project that
  already has these repos) no longer proposes re-scaffolding a repo that's already registered; a first
  run with no code-repo rows scaffolds everything exactly as before.

**Milestone-relative planning STEP-shape.**

- *Process docs* (`templates/planning-session.md`): the implementation planning session's STEP
  sequence (work-item 2, plus work-item 1's "first STEP is scaffold" line) is now milestone-relative —
  build or extend what the milestone needs, in dependency order, given what already exists, with the
  scaffold → data → capabilities → integration shape kept as the worked example for a first run. Adopt
  the reworded work-items. No `status.sh` / `check.sh` change.
- *Project state* (an existing project's roadmap in `prompts/STEP-index.md`): never auto-updated.
  Nothing is rewritten. The change is behavioral — a planning re-run or a later-phase plan now reads as
  *extend what's built* rather than *rebuild from scratch*; a first run with nothing built produces the
  same scaffold-first outline as before.

**Target the first uncompleted phase in planning.**

- *Process docs* (`templates/planning-session.md`): the implementation planning session now targets
  **the first uncompleted phase** — the lowest-numbered roadmap phase whose STEPs aren't all complete —
  instead of hardcoding **Phase 1** throughout; it defaults to Phase 1 on the first run. Adopt the
  reworded references (nine "Phase 1" mentions → "the target phase") and the new bullet deriving the
  phase from the roadmap. No `status.sh` / `check.sh` change.
- *Project state* (an existing project's roadmap in `prompts/STEP-index.md`): never auto-updated.
  Nothing is rewritten. The change is behavioral — once Phase 1 is complete, a planning re-run reads the
  next phase's scope and outlines its STEPs instead of being pointed back at Phase 1; a first run still
  targets Phase 1 with the same outline as before.

**Project-selectable check-in cadence.**

- *Templates for future use* (`templates/overview-template.md`): new projects get the optional,
  documented `<!-- CHECK-IN-CADENCE: 20 -->` marker beside `PROJECT-STATUS`; existing generated
  `overview.md` files are not rewritten.
- *Process docs / tooling* (`scripts/status.sh`, `scripts/check.sh`, `METHOD.md` §5 + §10.7,
  `AGENTS.md`, `templates/planning-session.md`, `runbooks/check-in.md`, `runbooks/README.md`,
  `runbooks/secrets-rotation.md`, `runbooks/dependency-supply-chain.md`, `prompts/README.md`): the
  check-in rhythm is reframed as "about every 20 STEPs (the project's cadence, adjustable)", and the
  updated `status.sh` reads a `CHECK-IN-CADENCE` marker from `overview.md` (default 20), flagging a
  heads-up (DUE) at `N-5` and OVERDUE at `N+5`. **This is a deliberate, opt-outable default shift:**
  once you pull the new `status.sh`, its check-in nagging recenters from today's DUE 10 / OVERDUE 20 to
  **DUE 15 / OVERDUE 25**. `check.sh` gains an optional warning (never a failure) if the marker is
  present but not a positive integer.
- *Project state* (an existing project's `overview.md`): never auto-updated, and no line is required.
  To keep the **exact previous window** (DUE 10 / OVERDUE 20), add `<!-- CHECK-IN-CADENCE: 15 -->`; for
  any other rhythm use that number (e.g. `50` → DUE 45 / OVERDUE 55); omit the line to take the new
  default of 20. The cadence stays a judgment-based guideline — you still place each check-in at a
  sensible breakpoint.

**Workspace model accepts in-place repos.**

- *Process docs* (`METHOD.md` §7, `registries/repos.yml` header): newly documented convention — a repo
  may be registered by a `location:` **outside the `Code/*` shell** (an absolute or otherwise arbitrary
  path), referenced in place, in addition to the created-as-sibling default. `scripts/setup-workspace.sh`
  already honors `location:` verbatim (clones from `remote:` into it, or references the repo in place
  when there's no remote), so there is **no tooling change** to pull. Keep `location:` and `remote:`
  distinct — a clone URL belongs in `remote:`, never folded into `location:`.
- *Project state* (existing `registries/repos.yml` and existing repos): never auto-updated. Nothing
  changes and no line is required — the `Code/*` sibling layout stays the default and existing rows are
  kept exactly as they are. Point a `location:` outside `Code/*` only if you want a repo referenced
  where it already lives. No `status.sh` / `check.sh` change.

**Bring-your-own inputs (`inputs/` folder).**

- *New scaffold folder* (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/` + its `README.md`): a durable drop point
  for documents you already have (product specs, prior architecture/protocol docs, UI designs,
  research). To adopt in an existing project, create the folder and copy `inputs/README.md` from
  the newer scaffold; `init.sh` seeds it for new projects.
- *Process docs* (`METHOD.md` §4, `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md`, `README.md`,
  `templates/overview-template.md`, all `templates/architecture-sessions/*`,
  `templates/planning-session.md`, `templates/substep-prompt-template.md`): sessions now read
  relevant `inputs/` documents alongside `overview.md`; the kickoff tells the user up front they
  can bring documents; a doc provided in chat is saved into `inputs/`. Adopt the reworded
  read-lists and the kickoff note. No `status.sh` / `check.sh` change.
- *Project state* (your `inputs/` contents): entirely yours — nothing is auto-created or
  rewritten. The folder is optional; a session reads what's there and ignores an empty folder.

### 1.7.1 migration

**Upgrading from 1.7.0?** A small follow-up that gives the `inputs/` folder a lifecycle. It rewrites
no project files and is greenfield-inert — the new ledger simply starts empty. Fast path:

1. Pull the process docs as one review-required group (`AGENTS.md`, `METHOD.md` §4,
   `runbooks/check-in.md`, `templates/architecture-sessions/01-system-overview.md` and
   `03-architecture-overview.md`, `templates/substep-prompt-template.md`,
   `templates/planning-session.md`, `templates/reports/check-in-report-template.md`).
2. Add the ledger: copy the scaffold's empty `inputs/inputs-index.md` (and the updated
   `inputs/README.md` guidance with it), then list any inputs you already have as `Live`.
3. Nothing else now. `inputs/archive/` is created only when you first retire an input, and the next
   check-in's inputs sweep is what surfaces a superseded input for a retire/keep decision.

The change establishes that **inputs are point-in-time** and `architecture/` is the living truth:
where a generated `architecture/` / `adr/` doc covers the same ground as an input, the generated doc
wins, and architecture-grade inputs are lifted into `architecture/` (a spec often a whole-file copy
or a light reformat). This is **low-friction: nothing is auto-rewritten**, and the §2 file-bucket
rules apply unchanged.

**Inputs lifecycle.**

- *New project-state file* (`inputs/inputs-index.md`): copy the scaffold's empty ledger in; from
  then on it is yours to maintain, like a registry (`registries/*.yml`). Record each existing input
  as `Live`, and mark parts `Superseded` as an `architecture/` doc captures them. A fresh project
  ships it empty, so a first run reads all of `inputs/` exactly as before.
- *Process docs* (`AGENTS.md` ground rules, `METHOD.md` §4, `runbooks/check-in.md`, the
  system-overview / architecture-overview session templates, `templates/substep-prompt-template.md`,
  `templates/planning-session.md`, `templates/reports/check-in-report-template.md`): adopt the
  point-in-time authority rule, the `inputs/archive/` read-exclusion, and the check-in inputs sweep.
  Apply them as a coherent review-required group. No `status.sh` / `check.sh` change.
- *Project state* (your `inputs/` contents): never auto-updated. Your existing input files are not
  touched or moved; they simply start `Live` in the ledger, and any retirement to `inputs/archive/`
  happens only when you decide it at a check-in.

## 3. Manual Mode

This guide works today even without updater tooling, a project manifest, or an upstream update
catalog.

1. Pick the target Throughstone release or commit from
   `https://github.com/mherschberg/Throughstone`.
2. Read the target release notes / `CHANGELOG.md` and identify the scaffold/process changes
   you may want.
3. Compare only scaffold/process material: `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   `UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`, `prompts/README.md`, `templates/`, `runbooks/`,
   `coding-standards/`, and `scripts/`.
4. Treat the file buckets in §2 as the authority. Never manually copy protected project state
   from upstream.
5. For each candidate change, write a short report: target release/ref, files reviewed,
   implication/risk, recommendation, and whether it needs a tracked STEP.
6. Apply only the reviewed changes the user explicitly approves, following the apply and STEP
   rules in §8 and §10, then run `scripts/check.sh`.

Manual mode is slower than tooling, but it is the default path until the manifest and catalog
described below exist.

## 4. Future Tooling Artifacts

A future updater should read two kinds of metadata.

### Project Manifest

The manifest lives in the docs hub at `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/.throughstone/manifest.yml`
when viewed from the workspace root. Within the docs hub, that same path is
`.throughstone/manifest.yml`.

The default upstream source is `https://github.com/mherschberg/Throughstone`. If a project
intentionally tracks a fork or private mirror instead, record that source in the manifest so
future checks compare against the right upstream.

```yaml
# .throughstone/manifest.yml
throughstone:
  installed_version: "0.1.0"
  installed_ref: "abc1234"
  source: "https://github.com/mherschberg/Throughstone"

files:
  - local_path: "METHOD.md"
    upstream_area: "docs-hub"
    upstream_path: "METHOD.md"
    kind: "process"
    policy: "review"
    installed_sha256: "..."

  - local_path: "scripts/status.sh"
    upstream_area: "docs-hub"
    upstream_path: "scripts/status.sh"
    kind: "script"
    policy: "review"
    installed_sha256: "..."

  - local_path: "templates/substep-prompt-template.md"
    upstream_area: "docs-hub"
    upstream_path: "templates/substep-prompt-template.md"
    kind: "template"
    policy: "future-only"
    installed_sha256: "..."
```

Manifest field meanings:

- `local_path` is relative to the initialized docs hub. For example,
  `Code/acme-docs/scripts/status.sh` on disk is recorded as `scripts/status.sh`.
- `upstream_area` names the logical scaffold area in the Throughstone source. For now, this
  guide only defines `docs-hub`, which maps to upstream `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/`.
- `upstream_path` is relative to `upstream_area`. For example, `upstream_area: "docs-hub"` plus
  `upstream_path: "scripts/status.sh"` maps to upstream
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/scripts/status.sh`.
- Future tooling combines `source`, `installed_ref`, `upstream_area`, and `upstream_path` to
  find the upstream file, and combines the initialized docs hub path with `local_path` to find
  the local file.

Keep upstream identifiers placeholder-free. Do not store the initialized project slug in an
upstream path, and do not depend on the Throughstone project-placeholder token surviving
bootstrap; `init.sh` intentionally replaces it in file contents.

The manifest is advisory state, not magic truth. If it is missing, stale, or inconsistent,
the updater must say so and fall back to a manual comparison.

### Upstream Update Catalog

Once updater tooling exists, each Throughstone release should ship an update catalog:

```yaml
version: "0.2.0"
changes:
  - area: "docs-hub"
    path: "scripts/setup-workspace.sh"
    group: "workspace-setup"
    kind: "script"
    risk: "medium"
    summary: "Improves repo registry parsing when only some repos have remotes."
    implications:
      - "Changes clone behavior for multi-repo workspaces."
      - "Does not modify project docs or application code."
    recommendation: "Review, then apply if setup-workspace.sh was not customized."

  - area: "docs-hub"
    path: "templates/planning-session.md"
    group: "planning-flow"
    kind: "template"
    risk: "low"
    summary: "Adds stronger CI scaffolding guidance."
    implications:
      - "Affects future planning sessions only."
      - "Does not update existing STEP plans."
    recommendation: "Update for future use."
```

Catalog entries must name implications plainly. The updater should also compute mechanical
risk signals instead of relying only on maintainer-written summaries.

## 5. Compare Model

For every scaffold-managed file, compare three versions:

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **base** | the file content recorded at install time, identified by `installed_sha256` |
| **local** | the file currently in this project |
| **upstream** | the file in the target Throughstone release |

Classify the result:

| Classification | Meaning | Default action |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| **already-current** | `local == upstream` | Report only. |
| **upstream-only** | `local == base`, upstream changed | Candidate for apply, still review risk. |
| **local-only** | local changed, upstream unchanged | Keep local; no update needed. |
| **diverged** | local changed and upstream changed | Manual review or merge; do not auto-apply. |
| **baseline-unknown** | install-time baseline is missing or cannot be verified | Report only; require manual review before any baseline is adopted or update is applied. |
| **untracked** | file is not in the manifest | Report only unless explicitly added to manifest. |
| **protected** | file is project-owned or generated | Never auto-apply. |
| **manifest-invalid** | checksum/path/ref is missing or inconsistent | Stop automatic actions; require manual comparison. |

Use precise wording: **"unchanged locally"** is acceptable; **"safe to apply"** is not.
For projects without a trustworthy install-time manifest, do not backfill the manifest by
treating today's local files as the original base. Mark those files `baseline-unknown` unless
their local content can be verified against a known installed upstream ref after bootstrap
normalization, or unless the user explicitly adopts a reviewed file as the new managed
baseline.

## 6. Mechanical Risk Signals

The updater should flag at least these signals:

- executable bit changed
- shell script changed
- file contains or changes `git`, `gh`, `ssh`, `curl`, `wget`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `chmod`,
  `chown`, `sudo`, `aws`, `kubectl`, or remote URLs
- status resolver or agent context changed (`status.sh`, `AGENTS.md`, `METHOD.md`)
- collaboration or numbering rules changed
- CI workflow changed
- file deletion or rename
- placeholder handling changed (the Throughstone project-placeholder token, generated project
  slug, repo paths)
- update group is incomplete
- affected repo has uncommitted changes

Mechanical signals do not replace the catalog; they catch omissions and force review.

## 7. Future Tooling Check Flow

1. Confirm the docs hub and workspace layout.
2. Read `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/.throughstone/manifest.yml` (or
   `.throughstone/manifest.yml` from inside the docs hub). If absent, use manual mode (§3)
   instead.
3. Fetch or locate the target Throughstone release metadata. If the process executes
   downloaded updater code, pin the release/ref and verify it using the release's published
   provenance mechanism before execution.
4. Read the upstream update catalog.
5. Build the three-way comparison for every manifest file.
6. Group related changes. If a group is incomplete, mark the whole group review-required.
7. Print a report with:
   - classification
   - bucket/policy
   - risk level and mechanical risk signals
   - human implications from the catalog
   - whether the update is future-only, review-required, manual-merge, or protected
8. Stop. The default tooling command must not write files.

## 8. Apply Rules

Only apply when all of these are true:

- user explicitly requested apply
- every affected repo has a clean working tree and index before the updater creates or switches
  branches and before it writes files
- upstream release/ref was selected; any downloaded executable updater code was verified using
  the release's published provenance mechanism
- file is not protected
- file is either `upstream-only` with a verified baseline or the user selected a manual merge
  result
- all files in the required update group are included

Branch rule:

- If the update meets the STEP threshold in §10, reserve a STEP and use the normal
  `step-NNNN-short-name` branch.
- If the update does not meet that threshold, use a dedicated scaffold-update branch so the
  change is still reviewable and easy to roll back.

This guide describes the process whether it is done manually or by future updater tooling.
Throughstone does **not** currently ship a `throughstone-update.sh` script. If/when one is
added, use command names that make the risk model clear, for example:

```bash
./throughstone-update.sh check
./throughstone-update.sh diff
./throughstone-update.sh apply --unchanged-local-only
./throughstone-update.sh apply METHOD.md scripts/status.sh
```

Avoid names like `--safe` or `--clean-only`; they imply more certainty than the updater has.

After apply:

1. Recompute and write manifest checksums for updated scaffold files.
2. Run the docs hub checks (`scripts/check.sh`).
3. Preserve the update report in the branch or commit message.
4. Tell the user what changed, what was skipped, and which manual review items remain.

## 9. Future Root Updater Shape

A future root updater may be tiny and replaceable:

1. locate the docs hub
2. read the manifest path
3. pin the requested upstream release/ref and verify executable updater code using the
   release's published provenance mechanism
4. run the verified updater from a temporary location
5. pass only project root, docs hub path, manifest path, and requested command

It must not store project state outside the manifest. If the root updater itself changes,
that update is reported and applied like any other script update.

## 10. When To Make It A STEP

Make a tracked STEP when the update:

- changes `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `status.sh`, collaboration rules, or STEP/ADR numbering
- touches more than one repo
- changes CI behavior
- requires manual merge decisions
- changes how future architecture sessions or planning sessions behave
- would affect an active team

The STEP's PLAN can be thin: point to this guide, list the update groups under review, and
define done as "report reviewed, selected updates applied, checks passed, manifest refreshed,
and skipped/protected files recorded."

# The Method

**Method version: 1.0** — the core method is stable; expect continued refinement, especially in the collaboration and scaffold-update layers.

How projects built with this scaffold are structured. This is the canonical reference;
the agent reads it to understand how to work. Read it once before you start.

The core idea: **decide and document the architecture before writing code**, break the
work into small runnable units, and keep a durable record of *what* the system is and
*why* it's that way.

---

## 1. The three tiers of work

```
Phase            e.g. Phase 1 = "MVP" / "POC"  a release-level milestone
  └─ STEP        e.g. STEP-1, STEP-2, STEP-87  a unit of work with a PLAN
       └─ Substep  e.g. 1.1, 1.5a               a single self-contained task
```

- **Phase** — a release-level container. *Phase 1 is your first release-level milestone —
  often an MVP for a new build, but it may be a POC, a prototype, or a full v1 (the kind is
  chosen at kickoff).* Later phases (Phase 2, Phase 3, …) are larger bodies of work you've
  deliberately deferred. Phases live as folders named for the chosen phase:
  `prompts/001-<phase-name>/` (e.g. `001-mvp/`), `prompts/002-<name>/` — the folder is created
  when the phase's first STEP is archived, and the next-action resolver keys on the index rows
  in `prompts/STEP-index.md`, not the folder names.

- **STEP** — the main unit of work. Every STEP has a **PLAN** that lists its substeps,
  the decisions already locked, ground rules, and a definition of done. STEP numbers are
  **global and never reset** — Phase 3 might open at STEP-87. A STEP ends in a review. Its
  status moves through **Planned → In progress → Done**. A STEP may be marked
  **Deferred** when it is consciously not needed under the current project shape but may be
  revisited later, or **Abandoned** if it was reserved but won't be built (the row stays so
  its number is never reused — see §8). These five are the only STEP states.

- **Substep** — the smallest unit: one focused task, written so it can be executed cold
  in a fresh chat. Numbered with dotted notation (`1.1`, `1.2`, `1.5a`). For the
  architecture STEP, each substep is an interactive **session** (see §4).

Not every change needs to become a STEP. A STEP is for work that benefits from explicit
planning, sequencing, coordination, preserved context, or architecture/doc review. Small,
well-understood changes can use the team's normal issue, branch, PR, test, and commit flow
without reserving a STEP number or writing a PLAN. Promote the work to a STEP when it changes
architecture, public contracts, data model, security posture, deployment behavior, multiple
repos, accepted risk/debt, or when the work is large or ambiguous enough that a future agent
would need durable planning context.

## 2. Architecture-first

**STEP-1 produces architecture docs and ADRs — no application code.** This is the most
important discipline in the method. You lock the shape of the system (what it does, how
it's structured, how it scales, how it's secured) before building, so you're not
rearchitecting on top of code later.

Only once the architecture is in place do later STEPs implement against it. The bridge
between the two is the **implementation planning session**
(`templates/planning-session.md`, run by name: *"run the planning session"*): after STEP-1
closes, it reads the locked architecture and **outlines all the Phase-1 implementation
STEPs** (a short scope each) into `prompts/STEP-index.md`. Each STEP's detailed PLAN is
written later, when you start it.

## 3. The two durable doc genres

Everything lives in the docs hub: `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/`.

| Genre | Location | Answers | Lifecycle |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Architecture docs** | `architecture/NN-*.md` | *What is the system?* | Living. Versioned (see §6), maintained as reality changes. |
| **ADRs** | `adr/ADR-NNNN-*.md` | *Why is it this way?* | Point-in-time. Never rewritten — superseded or amended. |

- **Architecture docs** are the single source of truth for the current design. When
  something changes, you update the doc and bump its version log.
- **ADRs** capture a decision at the moment it's made — context, the choice, alternatives
  rejected, consequences. You don't edit an ADR's decision later; you write a new ADR that
  supersedes it, or append a dated amendment. There's an index at `adr/README.md`.

Other folders in the hub: `coding-standards/` (per-language plus cross-cutting — `sql.md`,
`shell.md`, `api.md`; defaults ship for common languages, and the Test Strategy session
reconciles them to the stack you pick and records the result in the Test Strategy architecture
doc — review what's there, add what's missing, prune the rest), `runbooks/`
(repeatable procedures — ships with
`check-in.md`, `collaboration.md`, `release-deploy.md` (an optional, customizable
deploy/rollback checklist), `incident-postmortem.md` (respond to a production incident, then
spin up an Incident STEP to RCA → find similar → fix, with a postmortem report from
`templates/reports/incidents/incident-postmortem-report-template.md`), and `dependency-supply-chain.md` (vet a new dependency;
audit dependencies for vulns/licenses on a cadence); add your own operational ones),
`reports/` (durable review and operational reports, kept in the docs hub rather than inside
STEP folders — check-in reports live directly in `reports/`, `reports/incidents/` holds
incident postmortem reports, `reports/security/` holds security baseline, sweep, and audit
reports, and `reports/test-results/` holds durable test, coverage, and quality-gate result
reports),
`registries/`
(e.g. `repos.yml`, the repo inventory for multi-repo projects, and `risks.yml`, the accepted
risk / tech-debt register).

## 4. Architecture sessions

Each substep of STEP-1 is a **session**: an interactive interview prompt that walks you
through the decisions for one architecture area and writes the resulting doc. The full
set lives in `templates/architecture-sessions/`.

**Core sessions (default):**

| # | Session | Produces |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1.1 | System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals | `architecture/01-*` |
| 1.2 | Phasing & Roadmap | `architecture/02-*` |
| 1.3 | Architecture Overview & Component Boundaries *(asks which client surfaces — gates UI / Design System + app)* | `architecture/03-*` |
| 1.4 | Data Model, Ownership & Retention | `architecture/04-*` |
| 1.5 | Scaling & Performance | `architecture/05-*` |
| 1.6 | Security & Threat Model *(deferrable — but as a recorded, conscious decision)* | `architecture/06-*` |
| 1.7 | UI / Design System *(platform-aware; "no UI" → skip)* | `architecture/07-*` |
| 1.8 | Infrastructure & Deployment | `architecture/08-*` |
| 1.9 | Environments *(sandbox is a question inside)* | `architecture/09-*` |
| 1.10 | Observability | `architecture/10-*` |
| 1.11 | Interface Contracts | `architecture/11-*` |
| 1.12 | Test Strategy | `architecture/12-*` |
| 1.13 | Glossary | `architecture/13-*` |
| 1.14 | Cross-Cutting Review | review doc |

**Conditional sessions** are included only when relevant and are owned by the session that has
enough information to decide them: **Native app architecture** is decided by Session 1.3's
client-surfaces question; **Privacy, compliance & data governance** is decided when the Data
Model / Security sessions identify personal or regulated data; **Identity & auth** is decided
from the Security session's AuthN/AuthZ posture. Run each **by name**, not by number — *"run
the identity-auth session"* → `conditional-identity-auth.md` (likewise
`conditional-native-app.md`; *"run the privacy session"* or *"run the privacy-compliance
session"* → `conditional-privacy-compliance.md`) — slotted under a
lettered substep (e.g. `1.6a`, after the related core session). The STEP-1 PLAN records a
*Conditional sessions considered* table that names the owning session for each conditional and
tracks the current call: Include (→ substep), Deferred (with a revisit trigger), or N/A (with
a reason). This keeps a skip or deferral visible without forcing a decision before the
owning session has the facts. The Cross-Cutting Review and periodic check-in both enumerate
every `templates/architecture-sessions/conditional-*.md` file and re-evaluate its applicability,
so a newly added conditional automatically joins both safety nets. If the Cross-Cutting Review
finds a missing applicable session, it pauses, the conditional runs, and the review restarts
from the beginning. If a need emerges after STEP-1 — for example, the project later adds login
or starts collecting regulated data — the check-in files a follow-up STEP to run the
conditional by name.

### Running a session  *(Layer 1 — works in any agent)*

To run an architecture session, tell your agent:

> Run STEP-1.1: System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals

The agent reads the matching file in
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/architecture-sessions/NN-*.md` and follows it exactly:
it interviews you one decision at a time, then writes the output doc and updates
`prompts/STEP-index.md`. No copy-paste, no special commands. The shorter
*"STEP-1.N"* and *"session N.M"* forms also work, with or without a leading "Run" and with
or without `: <session label>`, but the labeled form gives chat/task UIs a clearer title.

Each session reads what it needs (`overview.md`, anything relevant in `inputs/`, and earlier
architecture docs) from disk, so **you can clear the chat / start fresh between sessions** —
the state lives in files, not in the conversation. This keeps STEP-1's many sessions from
piling up in one context.

### Bringing documents you already have  *(the `inputs/` folder)*

You don't have to start from a blank page. If you already have material that informs the
design — a product spec or PRD, prior architecture or design docs, a protocol or API
specification, UI designs, mockups or exported design files, competitor and prior-art
research, diagrams — put it in `inputs/` (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/`, any format). The
architecture sessions read the relevant documents from there and build on them instead of
re-deriving what you already know; hand a session a document **in chat** instead and it saves
a copy into `inputs/` so it persists for later sessions and fresh chats. The folder is durable
and **not STEP-1-only** — a later phase, a V2, or a check-in can drop in new inputs the same
way.

These documents are **point-in-time**: a starting point, not the living source of truth. As the
sessions capture an input's content into `architecture/` — synthesized for a PRD, or lifted as a
near-verbatim copy for a spec or other finished doc — that generated doc becomes the truth and the
captured parts go stale, so `inputs/` carries a small ledger (`inputs/inputs-index.md`) of what each
input still holds vs. what's been superseded, and a fully-superseded input is retired to
`inputs/archive/`, which sessions don't read. The periodic check-in reconciles this (§5). See
`inputs/README.md`.

### Sessions are re-runnable
A session isn't a one-time gate. If an assumption changes later — scaling needs grow, the
threat model shifts, a phase gets re-cut — **re-run that session** (for example,
*"Run STEP-1.5: Scaling & Performance"*).
It re-interviews you, **revises the existing architecture doc in place, and records the
change in that doc's Version Log** (and a new ADR if the decision is significant — the old
ADR is superseded, not edited). Re-running is the normal way the living docs stay true as
the project learns; it's not a sign something went wrong the first time.

### Adding a session
The session set is yours to extend — and the two kinds differ sharply in cost.

**A conditional session does not renumber the standard sessions.** Conditionals are lettered
substeps (`1.6c`, `1.7b`), so adding one leaves the numbered core intact. To add one:
1. Write `templates/architecture-sessions/conditional-<topic>.md` — copy an existing conditional
   for the shape (the two-numbers header note, a `Reads` line, the calibrate-to-experience note,
   explicit applicability and invocation, the decisions, Output, and Next). Preserve its two
   execution modes: a lettered STEP-1 substep, or a later follow-up STEP raised by a check-in.
2. Give its output doc the **next free number above the core block** (the conditional headers and
   §8 explain why), and slot its substep as a letter suffix wherever it belongs.
3. List it in §4's conditional paragraph and the `AGENTS.md` conditional set so it's invocable
   by name. Add its ownership guidance to `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` and seed its row in
   `templates/step-plan-template.md`'s *Conditional sessions considered* table. The bootstrap also
   enumerates `conditional-*.md`, so an unseeded new template is still surfaced rather than
   silently omitted.

`status.sh`, the Glossary session, the Cross-Cutting Review, and the periodic check-in all pick
it up with no further edits.

If a periodic check-in discovers a conditional after STEP-1, it becomes a thin,
architecture-only follow-up STEP rather than reopening the archived architecture STEP. Its
PLAN has one substep pointing directly to the conditional template (no duplicate prompt);
the PLAN also records the template's exact invocation and assigned output-doc number (reuse
the existing number for a re-interview; otherwise take the next free number above the core
block). The session writes or revises the architecture doc, reconciles related docs and
`architecture/README.md`, and records ADRs. Review the resulting architecture coherently,
then re-run the planning session if the remaining implementation roadmap needs to change.
Its index title starts `Conditional session:` so the next-action resolver runs this
architecture work before ordinary `Planned` implementation STEPs, even though its newly
reserved STEP number is higher.

**A standard (numbered) session costs a renumber, because the Cross-Cutting Review is always
last.** A new standard session inserts *before* the review, which shifts the review — and
anything after the insertion point — up by one. To add one:
1. Write `templates/architecture-sessions/NN-<topic>.md`; its doc number is the next in the core
   block. Append it right before the review to minimize the shift.
2. Renumber the review (and any shifted sessions): rename the file
   (`14-cross-cutting-review.md` → `15-…`) and update the exact-number contracts: session
   filenames/headings, the §4 core-session table, `templates/step-index-seed.md`, and each
   session's invocation/output contract. Use a broad audit such as
   `rg '1\.14|14-cross|architecture/14-'` to find leftovers, but keep dynamic prose dynamic:
   prefer session labels and topic globs outside invocation/output contracts. Run
   `scripts/check.sh` afterward; it is the mechanical backstop for heading/seed/output drift
   and for keeping the Cross-Cutting Review last.
3. Add its row to the §4 table and `templates/step-index-seed.md`.

`status.sh` needs no change — it locates the review by its label, not its number.

When in doubt, prefer a conditional: it carries the same interview-and-document machinery without
the renumber.

### Calibrating to the user's experience level
The kickoff (`BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md`, Stage 0) asks the active user how much experience they
have building a project like this and records it in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`:
**Level 1** (no coding experience), **Level 2** (basic coding experience), **Level 3**
(senior developer or above). This is a **personal, per-machine local profile**, not a
project fact. Each additional contributor creates their own profile during onboarding.
Every session reads this profile first, so each one sees it and **adjusts how it asks** —
the decisions reached are the same; only the explaining changes:

At any agent entry point — kickoff, resume, an architecture session, the planning session,
STEP planning, substep execution, or contributor onboarding — if root
`.throughstone/local-user.md` is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0,
create the file, and then continue. If the user gives an explicit style instruction in chat,
honor it for the current session; otherwise use `.throughstone/local-user.md`. To change the
default for future sessions, edit that file.

- **Level 1–2** — before each question, say in plain language *what* it's asking and *why* it
  matters, and lead with a recommended default. Don't assume jargon: concepts like scaling,
  security, threat model, infrastructure, and environments get a one-line "here's what this
  means for you" framing rather than being named and left bare.
- **Level 3** — assume fluency; keep it terse and decision-focused.
- **At any level**, the user can ask for a question to be unpacked — and they won't use a
  set phrase. Treat *any* sign of confusion or request to clarify as the cue: "what do you
  mean?", "why does that matter?", "huh?", a hesitation, a guess that misreads the question,
  or a literal *"explain what you're asking and why it matters."* Give the Level-1/2
  explanation on the spot, then re-ask. **Say so up front** — when you set the level (or at
  the first session), tell the user in plain terms that they can ask you to explain any
  question at any time; don't make them discover the affordance.

The level is advisory, not a gate: if the conversation shows the user is more or less
comfortable than they marked, adjust on the fly and correct the value in
`.throughstone/local-user.md`.

The same profile also records the user's default **Communication style**:
**Terse**, **Normal**, or **Explanatory**. Read it before user-facing project discussions,
especially STEP planning, and treat it as the saved default so the user is not asked the
same verbosity question repeatedly. Override precedence is: **explicit chat instruction for
this session** → **`.throughstone/local-user.md` default** → **ask and create the missing
profile**.

**Worked examples** — the *same* canonical question, rendered at each level. The substance is
identical; only the framing changes. Notice the recurring moves: Level 1 names the failure it
prevents and ends with a yes/no default so the user is never facing a blank prompt; Level 2
keeps the term but defines it inline the first time; Level 3 is terse and surfaces the
interesting trade-off, not the basics.

> *Non-goals (Session 1.1):*
> - **L1:** "Now the most important — and strangest — question: what are you deliberately **not** building, at least for now? Naming what you skip is the #1 thing that stops a project ballooning forever and never shipping. Two buckets: 'not yet' (good for later) and 'never' (just not what this is). One feature you'd firmly set aside for v1?"
> - **L2:** "Let's pin down non-goals — what you're deliberately leaving out, since that's what stops scope creep. Split 'not now' (deferred) vs. 'not ever' (out of scope by design). What's on each list?"
> - **L3:** "Non-goals — split 'not now' vs. 'not ever'. What are you explicitly excluding from v1?"

> *Threat model (Session 1.6):*
> - **L1:** "Now security. The common mistake is 'we're too small for anyone to attack us' — but most attacks are automated bots probing *everything*, not personal. So: if someone broke in, what would hurt most — leaking users' info, tampering with data, or the site going down? You don't need to know how to defend it, just what matters most."
> - **L2:** "A lightweight threat model. Skip the 'too small to be a target' instinct — anything public gets probed automatically. Name the assets worth protecting and the top threats: what would do the most damage if it leaked, got tampered with, or went down?"
> - **L3:** "Threat model — assets, trust boundaries, threats you actually care about. Crown-jewel data, and your stance on authn/authz, secrets, tenant isolation?"

> *Observability (Session 1.10):*
> - **L1:** "How will you *know* the app is healthy once people use it? The trap: it breaks, and the only signal is angry users — and even then you can't tell why. The fix is leaving yourself a trail of breadcrumbs to answer 'what happened?'. For v1 I'd suggest just good logs plus an alert if the site goes down. Enough to start?"
> - **L2:** "Observability — how you'll see what the system is doing in production; the failure mode is 'users told us it broke and we can't tell why.' Logs (what happened), metrics (is it healthy), alerts (tell me when it's not). For a first release I'd default to structured logs + an error/uptime alert and add dashboards later. Start there?"
> - **L3:** "Observability — logs/metrics/traces and alerting. SLOs now or later? I'd default to structured logging + error tracking + an uptime alert for a first release and defer tracing/SLOs unless you're latency-sensitive."

### Calibrating defaults to the project's facts
Experience level (above) changes *how* a session asks; the project's own recorded facts change
*what* it recommends. A session's default is **never** keyed to an assumed "MVP" — it reads the
facts the brief and earlier sessions captured, and it **splits breadth from rigor**:

- **Breadth** — how big and how public the system is (a modular monolith vs. microservices, one
  locale vs. many, the fewest environments that are safe) — tracks the **release stage and
  load** (`overview.md`'s *Release stage / launch target* and *Scale & shape*). An earlier,
  narrower launch justifies a simpler default here.
- **Rigor** — security controls, privacy process, availability — tracks **what's at stake**: the
  blast radius and data sensitivity (`overview.md`'s *Sensitive data & risk*). An early release
  stage is **never** a license to lower rigor on a high-stakes system: a closed beta that handles
  health data or payments still owes its users real protection.

So "for a first release" is a *breadth* default, set by stage and load — not a reason to thin out
rigor, which the session keys to blast radius instead.

## 5. The prompt lifecycle

```
Upcoming Prompts/      ← the STEP you're working on now (work-in-progress)
        │  (STEP completes + review passes)
        ▼
prompts/001-<phase-name>/step-NNNN/ ← archived: STEP PLAN + all substep prompts, kept for the record
```

- `prompts/STEP-index.md` is the **living roadmap** — every STEP, its status, one-line
  scope. It's the first place to look to understand where the project is.
- `prompts/README.md` holds the **conventions + the recipe for authoring a new STEP**.

**Apart from `prompts/README.md`, `prompts/` is history; the docs repo is state.** That's
why they're separate repos. `prompts/README.md` is process guidance; the rest of `prompts/`
records *how* the project was built, STEP by STEP — it spans all the code repos in the
project and is never rewritten. `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/` describes *what the system is now*
— it's kept current. Don't fold one into the other.

- **`prompts/` is its own repo** (project-wide; it cuts across the code repos).
- **`Upcoming Prompts/` is a workspace folder, not generally a repo** — it's scratch space
  for the STEP in flight, un-versioned until the STEP completes and is moved into
  `prompts/`. (You *can* make it a repo if you want in-flight work versioned; most don't.)
  It's the one allowed working folder at the workspace root (see §7 hygiene).

### Authoring and revising a STEP
A STEP's **PLAN and all its substep prompts are written together in a single chat** — that
session holds the whole STEP in mind, so the substeps are coherent. But they are **not
frozen**: while executing the substeps, decisions made in an earlier substep often change
what a later substep should do. Update the affected substep prompts (and the PLAN) as you
go — the prompts should reflect the current intent, not the original guess.

Authoring a STEP is a planning action, not execution approval. If the user's command names a
whole implementation STEP (`run STEP N`, `start STEP N`, `kick off STEP N`, or similar),
write or revise the PLAN and substep prompts, present them, and wait. Actual work begins only
after an explicit substep command (or, for a thin conditional follow-up STEP, an explicit
by-name conditional-session invocation).

Treat STEP planning as an interactive discussion, not a silent document-generation task.
Before writing the PLAN, confirm the scope with the user and ask for clarification when
requirements, sequencing, dependencies, or ownership are unclear. When the user needs to
make a planning choice, offer plausible options with brief pros and cons, then wait for
direction. Use the saved **Communication style** in `.throughstone/local-user.md` as the
default level of detail while still asking the questions needed to make the STEP coherent.
For any code-changing STEP, read the Test Strategy architecture doc during planning, assign
the relevant test tiers (unit, integration, API/contract, end-to-end, security/authorization,
migration/data, performance, or project-specific) to the substeps that introduce the behavior,
and make the STEP's final test command or CI gate explicit. Tests may run per substep or in a
dedicated final verification substep; choose deliberately in the PLAN. A code-changing substep
without tests needs a stated reason, not silence.

### Check-in STEPs
About **every 20 STEPs** (the project's cadence, adjustable), the roadmap includes a **Check-in STEP** — a full STEP whose
job is to run `runbooks/check-in.md`: reconcile the architecture docs against the code in
**both directions** (stale doc → fix the doc/write an ADR; code drifted from a still-correct
doc → file a bug), re-evaluate every available conditional architecture session, review the
accepted risks/debt in `registries/risks.yml`, and **run the full test suite**. The
implementation planning session
interleaves these when it outlines a phase, placing each at a sensible breakpoint (after a
capability lands, not mid-feature). Treat the cadence as a guideline — pick the breakpoint by
judgment. **The cadence is a per-project setting** (recommended **20**): the target is recorded as
`<!-- CHECK-IN-CADENCE: N -->` in `overview.md`, and any project can change it at any time — including
one that pulls this scaffold into an existing codebase and wants a different rhythm. `status.sh` reads
that value (defaulting to **20** when the line is absent) and flags a heads-up **5 STEPs before** the
target and overdue **5 after** — so the default 20 gives a heads-up at 15 and overdue at 25. The agent
should also **proactively suggest** inserting a check-in when about that
many STEPs have passed since the last one. This is the periodic safety net; it's separate
from the continuous rule that every substep updates the doc it changes.
The completed check-in report is written to `reports/YYYY-MM-DD-step-NNNN-check-in-report.md`;
the archived STEP folder in `prompts/` keeps the thin PLAN, not the durable report.

### Milestone doc review
A **phase is a release-level milestone** (§1), and two kinds of documentation fall *outside*
the per-STEP engineering discipline — they're written for people outside the build, not to
keep the code's own docs true:
- **Release notes** — a human-readable "what shipped" for the milestone.
- **End-user / product docs** — user guides, help, tutorials. These are otherwise **out of
  scope** of this method, which documents the *engineering*, not the product surface.

Because nothing in normal STEP work produces them, they need a deliberate prompt: **at each
milestone (a phase completing, or any release you cut), the agent proactively asks the user**
whether user-facing docs need updating and whether to write release notes. If the user wants
release notes, start from `templates/release-notes-template.md` and trim sections that do not apply.
The user decides how much to do — the method's job is to *raise it at the right moment*, not
to mandate the output.

## 6. Versioning architecture docs

Each architecture doc carries three independent header facts — an identity **number**, a
maturity **status**, and (optionally) a **coverage** note — plus a change log:
- **`Version:`** — identity / number, `major.minor.patch`. Bump *patch* for
  fixes/clarifications, *minor* for added sections/decisions, *major* for a **breaking
  architectural change** (a decision that supersedes a prior one). The number is **decoupled
  from maturity**: `major` no longer marks a maturity "era," so a project already on its own
  house convention (a calendar date, a `v16`-style line) may keep it — the lifecycle lives in
  `Status`, not in the digits.
- **`Status:`** — the doc's **maturity lifecycle**, the authoritative *"is this doc the current
  agreed truth?"* signal, independent of the number: **Draft** (not yet — `v0.x`, pre-release,
  shape still unstable) → **Current** (yes — the live, agreed description you can depend on) →
  **Deprecated** (no longer — the doc is retired). A doc is deprecated either because a newer doc
  supersedes it or because the thing it described was removed (a server, a feature); either way it is
  kept for history, not deleted, with a short note on why — and a pointer to its replacement when there
  is one. A project may rename the rungs, but only to *settledness synonyms* (e.g.
  WIP / Reviewed / Locked) — never a scope word (MVP) or a release-stage word (Beta / GA), which
  are different axes. A **`Deprecated` doc is excluded from the check-in's doc-drift and
  deferred-coverage sweeps** (`runbooks/check-in.md`): it is listed as retired for the record,
  not reconciled against current code or backfilled.
- **`Coverage:`** *(optional)* — how completely the doc describes its area. Omit it (or `full`)
  when the doc fully covers the area; mark a deliberately fat or partial area `deferred` (or
  `enumerated to depth N`) so the gap is recorded rather than mistaken for drift. Every check-in
  resurfaces a `Coverage: deferred` doc for an explicit disposition (`runbooks/check-in.md`).
- A **Version Log** table at the bottom: one row per change (version, date, STEP, what).

ADRs are *not* versioned this way — they're dated, carry a Status (Accepted / Superseded /
…), and accumulate appended amendments.

## 7. Repos & the workspace shell

Projects are typically **multi-repo**: the workspace folder is *not* itself a repo;
inside it, `prompts/` is one repo and each thing under `Code/` (including
`quasar-disney-mobile-docs`) is its own **sibling** repo. Nothing sits "above" those repos except a
per-machine shell. The `init.sh` wizard sets this up for the first developer; service repos
aren't created at bootstrap — they're stamped from
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/repo-readme-template.md` once the architecture names them. (Or choose
mono-repo-for-now in the wizard — see *Mono-repo for now* below.) For multi-repo projects,
`registries/repos.yml` is the canonical inventory. `registries/risks.yml` is the canonical
accepted risk / tech-debt register: when a risk or debt item is consciously deferred, record it
there with owner, severity, revisit trigger, and a reference to the durable source artifact
that explains it. If no source exists yet, create the right one first — an architecture
decision/section, ADR, issue/follow-up STEP, incident report under `reports/incidents/`, or
check-in report under `reports/` — then add the register row. **Every repo carries a README explaining
what it is** — its role and the slice of the system it owns — stamped from that template and
filled in when the repo is scaffolded (with a matching one-line `description` in
`registries/repos.yml`); a repo with real internal complexity adds an `ARCHITECTURE.md` at
its root for its internal design. **Every new application-code repo also inherits the
project-license posture established by `init.sh`:** read the authoritative selection from the
docs hub's `.throughstone/project-license`. For an open-source selection, the docs hub must have
a matching canonical `LICENSE`, which is copied unchanged to the new repo root. For
`Proprietary`, the new repo gets no project `LICENSE`. Do not copy `LICENSE-THROUGHSTONE` into
application-code repos that contain no Throughstone-authored material. Repos scaffolded through
this method do contain the Throughstone-authored README and CI starter, so
`scripts/apply-project-license.sh` copies `LICENSE-THROUGHSTONE` and writes a visible
`LICENSING.md` that distinguishes retained scaffold material from project-authored code.

**Where a repo lives — created as a sibling, or registered in place.** By default a repo is
**created as a `Code/*` sibling** under the workspace root, and its `registries/repos.yml`
`location:` is that workspace-relative sibling path — the layout `init.sh` and the scaffolding
above assume. A repo may instead be **registered in place by its `location:`** — a path
*outside* the `Code/*` shell (an absolute path, or any other arbitrary path) — in addition to that
created-as-sibling default, so a repo that lives elsewhere is referenced where it sits rather than
created under `Code/`. `location:` records wherever the repo actually is; the optional `remote:` is
unchanged (a cloneable URL when the repo has one).
`scripts/setup-workspace.sh` honors `location:` verbatim either way — it clones from `remote:`
into that path when a remote is set, and otherwise leaves the repo referenced where it sits.
Branch-per-STEP and the overlap warning (`runbooks/collaboration.md`) key on repo
**identity** — its `repos.yml` entry, not where it lives — so an in-place repo participates in
them exactly like a sibling. The `Code/*` sibling layout stays the default.

**All durable content lives in a repo** — almost always `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/`. The
workspace root holds only **per-machine** files: the pointer `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
(which redirect to the canonical `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/AGENTS.md`) and `.claude/` config.
These are not versioned (the root is not a repo) and are regenerated on each developer's
machine by `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/scripts/setup-workspace.sh`.

**Workspace-root hygiene:** besides the per-machine pointers/config, the repo folders, and
the `Upcoming Prompts/` working folder, no other file should sit at the workspace root (the
one-time `init.sh` may linger there until you delete it post-bootstrap — that's expected). If
any *other* file appears, ask whether it belongs in a repo (usually the docs hub) and move it.

**Path conventions in docs.** Top-level agent-facing docs (`AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md`,
this file) write paths **relative to the workspace root** — `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/architecture/…`,
`prompts/STEP-index.md`. The exception is the **session and template files** under
`templates/`: because they live and operate inside the docs hub, they write hub-local paths
(`architecture/*-data-model.md`, `adr/`, `overview.md`) relative to the hub. Either way, a reference
that **crosses into another repo is always written in full** — most notably
`prompts/STEP-index.md`, which lives in `prompts/`, never the hub, so it is never written bare.

**Mono-repo for now:** the wizard offers a single-repo start — then the **workspace root
itself is that one repo** (the lone exception to "the root is not a repo" above), with
`prompts/` and `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/` as folders inside it rather than sibling repos. In
this mode the root pointers (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) are just ordinary committed files, not
per-machine artifacts, and the hygiene rule relaxes to match. It's a convenience for getting
moving solo; the multi-repo layout is the target. **Team collaboration assumes multi-repo.**
What a team actually needs is **shared remotes** (so the push-reject that referees STEP-number
reservation can fire — `runbooks/collaboration.md` §2); on top of that, the overlap warning
(§4 there) is repo-granular, so it's meaningless when every STEP touches the one mono-repo. So
split before you go team. Splitting later is standard git (extract `prompts/`
and the docs hub into their own repos); afterward, fill in the `remote:` fields in
`registries/repos.yml` and have others run `scripts/setup-workspace.sh`.

**Working with others:** every STEP is worked on its own branch (`step-NNNN-short-name`, same
name in every repo it touches) — **solo too**, so the workflow doesn't change the day a second
contributor arrives. The payoff is that when more than one developer or agent *is* active,
concurrent STEPs are the normal case — git keeps them isolated. The main thing that must be coordinated is
the **global STEP number**: adding a STEP row to `prompts/STEP-index.md` *is* reserving its
number, so it's committed and pushed **before** branching, and the loser of a race renumbers.
**ADR numbers are reserved the same way** — the registry in `adr/README.md` is shared, so two
authors appending the same number merge into a silent duplicate unless they renumber.
Decisions are socialized through ADRs (`Proposed` → `Accepted` in a team). Full conventions —
shared-file editing, the overlap warning, ADR authority, solo→team onboarding — are in
`runbooks/collaboration.md`.

**STEP-1 special case:** `init.sh` seeds `STEP-1` as `Planned`; the kickoff is the project
setup that creates the STEP-1 PLAN and records which architecture sessions will be run. When
kickoff closes, flip the `STEP-1` row to `In progress`. Use the branch name
`step-0001-architecture` for STEP-1 work wherever branch-per-STEP applies (docs hub and
`prompts/` in multi-repo projects; the root repo in mono-repo-for-now). In a team/shared-remote
project, push the `In progress` flip so others can see that the architecture STEP is active.

## 8. Naming conventions

| Thing | Pattern | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Phase folder | `NNN-kebab-name/` | `001-mvp/` |
| STEP folder (archived) | `step-NNNN/` | `step-0001/`, `step-0087/` |
| STEP plan | `quasar-disney-mobile-STEP-N-PLAN.md` | `acme-STEP-1-PLAN.md` |
| Substep prompt | `quasar-disney-mobile-STEP-N.M-PROMPT.md` | `acme-STEP-1.5a-PROMPT.md` |
| Architecture doc | `NN-kebab-title.md` | `06-security-model.md` |
| ADR | `ADR-NNNN-kebab-title.md` | `ADR-0004-pick-postgres.md` |
| STEP branch | `step-NNNN-short-name` | `step-0042-payment-webhooks` |

All filenames are kebab-case Markdown. A STEP number is written **unpadded in prose and the
index** (`STEP-7`) but **zero-padded to four digits in folder and branch names**
(`step-0007/`, `step-0007-short-name`). STEP numbers are global; architecture doc and ADR
numbers are sequential and never reused. (An abandoned STEP keeps its number — mark its index
row **Abandoned**, never delete it — so `max + 1` never reissues the number.) **Each STEP is
worked on its own branch** (above) —
the same branch name in every repo the STEP touches, even when you're working solo (it makes
concurrent work collision-free the day a second contributor arrives; see §7 and
`runbooks/collaboration.md`).

## 9. Updating the method itself

This file and the templates/runbooks beside it were **copied into your project** at
bootstrap — they're yours to edit, and upstream improvements to the Throughstone
template don't reach you automatically. Chasing them is rarely worth it, but if you ever want
a later improvement, follow `UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`: it compares the project against an
upstream Throughstone release, reports what changed, and separates "can be applied without a
text merge" from "safe." Pull only scaffold/process material — `METHOD.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`UPDATING-THROUGHSTONE.md`, `prompts/README.md`, `templates/`, `runbooks/`,
`coding-standards/`, and `scripts/` — and only after review.
Never auto-update your own `architecture/`, `adr/`, `overview.md`, `prompts/STEP-index.md`,
archived `prompts/<phase>/` content, application code, or files stamped from templates into
project repos.

Treat scaffold updates as advisory by default. Scripts can change behavior, templates affect
future generated work, and process docs can alter how contributors or agents operate. When an
update touches method rules, agent context, collaboration/numbering, CI, multiple repos, or
requires manual merge decisions, make it a tracked STEP and apply it on that STEP's branch.

## 10. What to do next (the next-action resolver)

The next action is always derivable from **disk**, never from chat memory — so any agent in a
fresh chat (and any teammate who just joined) can answer *"what do I do next?"* by reading
`prompts/STEP-index.md` (plus the in-flight PLAN in `Upcoming Prompts/` for sub-STEP
granularity). Every session and STEP also **ends by stating the next action** and telling you
to start a fresh chat for it — clearing context between units is the norm, since the state
lives in files (§4, §5).

> **Shortcut:** `scripts/status.sh` runs this resolver mechanically — it prints where you
> are, the next action, and the check-in cadence straight from the index. It's the mechanism a
> resuming agent runs first (see `AGENTS.md`, "First action"); the rules below remain
> authoritative when a case is ambiguous or the script isn't available.

Quick resolver:

| First matching state in `prompts/STEP-index.md` | Next action |
| --- | --- |
| STEP-1 has an open design substep | Run the lowest-numbered open session |
| STEP-1 design is done, Cross-Cutting Review open | Run Cross-Cutting Review |
| STEP-1 complete and no implementation STEPs exist yet | Run the planning session |
| Conditional-session follow-up STEP planned and none in progress | Plan that conditional follow-up, then wait for approval |
| Planned implementation STEPs exist and none in progress | Plan the lowest-numbered planned STEP, then wait for approval |
| A STEP is in progress | Open its PLAN, identify the lowest open substep, and wait for an explicit substep command |
| Check-in cadence is due | Propose a Check-in STEP |
| Phase is complete | Do milestone doc review, then plan the next phase |

Resolve the next action top-down against the index — the first rule that matches wins:

1. **STEP-1 has a `Planned` / `In progress` substep?** → run the lowest-numbered open one
   in a fresh chat using `Run STEP-1.N: <Session label from the index>`; the label is
   optional but preferred because it gives the chat/task a clearer title. Skip any substep marked `N/A` or `Deferred`. A substep with a
   **letter suffix** (e.g. `1.6a`, `1.7a`) is a **conditional session** the kickoff slotted
   in — use `Run STEP-1.Xa: <Conditional session label>` plus the invocation **by name**
   (*"run the identity-auth session"* / *"run the native-app session"* / *"run the privacy
   session"* or *"run the privacy-compliance session"*), since its template file is named by
   topic, not by number (see §4).
2. **All STEP-1 design sessions done but the Cross-Cutting Review is still open?** → run the
   substep whose Session label is **Cross-Cutting Review**.
3. **Cross-Cutting Review done and STEP-1 complete, but only the STEP-1 row exists?** →
   *"run the planning session"* — it outlines the Phase-1 implementation STEPs (§2).
4. **A `Conditional session: …` follow-up STEP is `Planned`, and no STEP is `In progress`?**
   → plan the lowest-numbered such follow-up before returning to implementation. Author its
   thin one-substep PLAN as described in §4, record the conditional's by-name invocation, then
   stop for approval. Run the conditional only when the user explicitly invokes it by name.
5. **Implementation STEPs outlined (`Planned`) but none `In progress`?** → plan the
   lowest-numbered `Planned` STEP: in a fresh chat, confirm scope, author its PLAN + substep
   prompts (`prompts/README.md` → "Recipe: adding a new STEP"), update the index, then stop
   for user approval. A whole-STEP command such as *"run STEP 6"*, *"run STEP-6"*,
   *"start STEP 6"*, or *"kick off STEP 6"* means **plan the STEP and wait**; it is not
   approval to execute the substeps you just created.
6. **A STEP is `In progress`?** → open its PLAN in `Upcoming Prompts/` and run only the
   explicitly requested substep: *"run substep N.M"*. If the user says only *"run STEP N"*,
   identify the lowest open substep and wait for that explicit substep command. When the last
   substep is done, run the STEP's review,
   then archive it (§5) and mark it `Done`.
7. **~20 STEPs (the project's cadence) since the last check-in?** → propose a **Check-in STEP** at the next
   sensible breakpoint (§5; `runbooks/check-in.md`).
8. **The phase is complete?** → it's a **milestone**: first prompt the user about **release
   notes** (use `templates/release-notes-template.md` if yes) and **any user-facing doc updates** (§5,
   *Milestone doc review*), then open the next phase and re-run the planning session for it.

When the index and an in-flight PLAN disagree, the **index** is authoritative for *which
STEP* is next; the **PLAN** owns *which substep* within it.

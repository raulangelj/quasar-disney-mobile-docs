## Inputs Reviewed

Use these sections for the major inputs that shaped the sweep. Add or remove sections as needed
for the project. Each section should be brief but complete enough that a future reviewer can tell
what was checked, what was skipped, and why the evidence was sufficient.

## Advisory Sources Checked

Use the starter sources from
[`runbooks/security-review-s1-checklist.md`](../../../runbooks/security-review-s1-checklist.md),
then add or remove rows based on the project stack. Keep rows for skipped-but-relevant sources so
the reason is explicit.

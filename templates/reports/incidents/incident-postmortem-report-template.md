## Classification

**Customer-facing:** {{Yes / No / Unknown}}
**Revenue-impacting:** {{Yes / No / Unknown}}
**Impact level:** {{1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5}}
**Severity rationale:** {{why this level fits}}

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Minor issue with a workaround; limited inconvenience, no meaningful service degradation. |
| 2 | Minor issue with no workaround; limited scope, but affected users or teams are blocked until fixed. |
| 3 | Moderate impact; meaningful degradation, partial outage, data issue, or repeated user pain. |
| 4 | Major impact; broad outage, critical workflow broken, serious data/security concern, or high operational load. |
| 5 | Critical impact; severe business/customer harm, confirmed revenue loss, data loss/exposure, legal/compliance concern, or executive-level incident. |

## Impact

- **Affected users/customers:** {{who was affected, including approximate count if known}}
- **Affected systems:** {{services, repos, environments, integrations}}
- **Impact duration:** {{start -> end, or "unknown"}}
- **Blast radius:** {{scope of affected data, workflows, tenants, regions, or teams}}
- **Data/security/privacy exposure:** {{none / suspected / confirmed, with reference if applicable}}

## Timeline

| Time | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| {{time}} | {{what happened}} | {{alert, log, deploy, user report, operator note}} |

## Detection & Response

- **Detected by:** {{alert / log / user report / operator / other}}
- **Detection gap:** {{what should have caught this earlier, or "None identified"}}
- **Immediate mitigation:** {{rollback, feature flag, failover, manual repair, other}}
- **Recovery verification:** {{checks that proved the system was healthy again}}
- **What helped response:** {{signals, runbooks, tooling, team actions}}
- **What slowed response:** {{missing signals, unclear ownership, tooling gaps, docs gaps}}

## Root-Cause Analysis

**Symptom:** {{what users/operators saw}}

**Root cause:** {{the changeable system cause, not a person or "a bug" by itself}}

**Contributing factors:**
- {{missing test, missing guardrail, design assumption, process gap, observability gap, etc.}}

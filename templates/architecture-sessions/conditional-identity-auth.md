# quasar-disney-mobile — Identity & Auth (Conditional Session)

> **Conditional.** Include this if the project has users/accounts or any access control
> worth designing (most apps with login do). The kickoff slots it in as a substep (e.g.
> `1.6a`, after the Security & Threat Model session) and the index records its number. Run it by name:
> *"run the identity-auth session."* It writes `architecture/NN-identity-auth.md` (number
> assigned in the STEP-1 index when run there, or in the follow-up PLAN when run later) and
> updates `prompts/STEP-index.md`.
> It may also be scheduled later as its own follow-up STEP when a periodic check-in finds
> that identity/auth has become applicable. In that mode, use the follow-up STEP's status
> and review bookkeeping rather than reopening STEP-1.
> **Two separate numbers:** the *substep* number (e.g. `1.6a`) marks its place in STEP-1; the
> *doc file* number (`NN`) is the next free number **above the reserved core-doc block** — the
> standard sessions reserve a contiguous block at the front (the current core set is the session
> table in `METHOD.md` §4), and each conditional takes the next free number above that block
> if another conditional already claimed the first one — **not** the lowest unused number. (This session may run
> early, e.g. at `1.6a`, before the later core docs exist; still take the first free number
> above the core block, so a not-yet-run core session keeps its own reserved slot without a clash.) The substep
> number and the doc number don't have to match.
> Reads `overview.md`, the Architecture Overview architecture doc (`architecture/*-architecture-overview.md`),
> the Data Model architecture doc (`architecture/*-data-model.md`), and the Security & Threat Model architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-security-threat-model.md`) first, plus the active STEP PLAN in
> `Upcoming Prompts/` when this is a later follow-up.
> **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Check the **Experience level** in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`: at Level 1-2 (no/basic coding background) explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain language - leading with a recommended default - before asking, and skip bare jargon. If the file is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it, then continue. Also check **Communication style** there and use it as the default level of detail; an explicit style request in chat overrides it for this session only. At any level, treat any confusion or request to clarify - in any words, not just those - as a cue to explain plainly, and tell the user up front they can ask. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

## About quasar-disney-mobile
A mobile app using react native to replicate a streaming applicacion just like Disney+

## What this session does
Building on the data model and threat model, we'll design how users prove who they are and
what each is allowed to do — including the big build-vs-buy call of whether to use a managed
identity provider.

## Why this session matters
Authentication ("who are you?") and authorization ("what may you do?") are easy to get
subtly, dangerously wrong, and very expensive to retrofit. This session designs them
deliberately — and, importantly, decides **build vs. buy**, since rolling your own identity
is a common and costly mistake. It expands on the AuthN/AuthZ posture set in the Security &
Threat Model session.

## How this session works
- One decision at a time; **wait** for answers.
- Strongly recommend a **managed identity provider** for most projects, and flag the
  obligations of rolling your own; flag what each choice forecloses.
- Keep it consistent with the Data Model architecture doc and the Security & Threat Model
  architecture doc.

## Decisions to make (in order)
1. **Authentication methods.** Password, OAuth/social, SSO/SAML/OIDC, passwordless/magic
   link, MFA. Which now, which later — keyed to what you're protecting (the threats and data
   sensitivity), not the release stage.
2. **Identity provider — build vs. buy.** Managed (Auth0, Cognito, Clerk, Firebase,
   Keycloak self-host) vs. roll-your-own. Default: **buy**, unless there's a strong reason.
   Record the decision (an ADR).
3. **User / account model.** How users, accounts, and (if relevant) organizations relate —
   consistent with the data model. Account lifecycle: signup, verification, recovery,
   deactivation, deletion.
4. **Authorization model.** Roles (RBAC), attributes/policies (ABAC), or simple
   ownership-based permissions. What roles/permissions exist and how they're enforced.
5. **Multi-tenancy** (if applicable). Are users isolated by org/tenant? How is tenant
   isolation enforced in data and access?
6. **Sessions & tokens.** Session cookies vs. JWT/access+refresh tokens; lifetimes,
   refresh, and revocation. Where tokens are stored on the client (ties to web/native
   security).
7. **Service-to-service auth** (if multi-service). How components authenticate to each
   other (mTLS, signed service tokens, pre-shared credentials).

## Output
Write `architecture/NN-identity-auth.md` (use `templates/architecture-doc-template.md`; NN per the
active STEP's index/PLAN). If the doc already exists, revise it in place and bump its Version
Log instead of creating a second identity/auth doc. Body covers each area above. Fill the
**Decision Summary**, record **Open Questions**, and capture the build-vs-buy and
authorization-model choices as **ADRs**. Reconcile any affected architecture docs. If this
is a later follow-up STEP, add or update this doc's row in `architecture/README.md`. Update
the active PLAN to mark this substep done. In STEP-1 mode, also mark the lettered substep
done in `prompts/STEP-index.md`. In follow-up mode, keep the parent STEP `In progress` there
until its review and normal completion bookkeeping are finished.

## Next
If this session was slotted into STEP-1, mark its lettered substep done; the next action is
the lowest open STEP-1 substep in the index. If the Cross-Cutting Review discovered it, that
review remains open and must restart from the beginning after this session. If a periodic
check-in scheduled this as a later follow-up STEP, complete that STEP's normal review and
bookkeeping instead of modifying STEP-1; re-run the planning session before more
implementation work if these decisions change the remaining roadmap. Tell the user to
**start a fresh chat** for the next action from the resolver in `METHOD.md` §10.

**Begin now — in this same reply.** "run the identity-auth session" is your go-ahead, not a request for acknowledgement: don't say "ready when you are", don't recap this file, don't ask whether to start. Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md`, anything relevant in `inputs/`, the relevant architecture docs, and any active follow-up PLAN silently; the PLAN determines the execution mode and output-doc number when this is not part of STEP-1. Then, in this one reply: **(1)** tell the user — in the one or two sentences from **What this session does** above — what you're about to cover (plain language); then **(2)** immediately **ask decision 1**, calibrated to the profile's experience level. That orientation plus the first question is your entire first reply — nothing more.

# quasar-disney-mobile — Security & Threat Model (Session 1.6)

> **How to run:** Tell your agent *"STEP-1.6"* or *"session 1.6"*; a leading *"Run"* and
> `: Security & Threat Model` are optional (but the label helps chat titles). It interviews you one decision at a
> time, then writes the Security & Threat Model architecture doc
> (`architecture/06-security-threat-model.md`) and updates `prompts/STEP-index.md`.
> Reads `overview.md`, the Architecture Overview architecture doc (`architecture/*-architecture-overview.md`),
> and the Data Model architecture doc (`architecture/*-data-model.md`) first.
> **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Check the **Experience level** in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`: at Level 1-2 (no/basic coding background) explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain language - leading with a recommended default - before asking, and skip bare jargon. If the file is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it, then continue. Also check **Communication style** there and use it as the default level of detail; an explicit style request in chat overrides it for this session only. At any level, treat any confusion or request to clarify - in any words, not just those - as a cue to explain plainly, and tell the user up front they can ask. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

## What this session does
Given the components and data from the last sessions, we'll work out what could realistically
go wrong security-wise and the protections this first version actually needs — no fortress,
but no negligence either.

Terminology: **Security & Threat Model** is the Session 1.6 process name;
`architecture/*-security-threat-model.md` is the **Security & Threat Model architecture
doc** it produces (the exact output file is named in the Output section below); **security
posture** and **security controls** are the concrete decisions governed by that doc, such as
assets, trust boundaries, mitigations, AuthN/AuthZ posture, secrets handling,
dependency-risk posture, and web-risk posture.

## Why this session matters
"We're too small to be a target" is the most common — and most wrong — security
assumption. Anything on the public internet gets probed automatically; attackers don't
check your user count first. You don't need a fortress for a *low* blast radius, but you do for
a high one — either way, know your **assets, your boundaries, and the threats you're choosing to
accept**. This session
can end in a *deliberate, recorded* deferral — but deferral must be a decision, not an
oversight.

## How this session works
- One decision at a time; **wait** for answers.
- For each threat, recommend a **mitigation matched to its blast radius** and note that
  **blast radius** if it's skipped.
- Keep it concrete to *this* system — use the assets and boundaries from the
  Architecture Overview architecture doc and the Data Model architecture doc.

## Decisions to make (in order)
1. **Assets.** What's worth protecting? (Credentials/keys, personal data, money/payments,
   proprietary data, availability itself.) List them — everything else hangs off this. (If
   **personal/regulated data** is among them, this session covers keeping attackers *out* of
   it; handling it *lawfully* — regimes, consent, retention, deletion rights — is the
   conditional Privacy/compliance session. Add that row, or mark it `Deferred` with a revisit
   trigger if the data is planned for a later phase.)
2. **Trust boundaries.** Where does data cross a line of trust? (Internet → your service;
   user → admin; your service → third party; service → service.) Each boundary is where
   threats live.
3. **Threats per boundary** (STRIDE-lite). For each boundary, which apply: impersonation/
   spoofing, tampering, replay, information disclosure, denial of service, privilege
   escalation, insider misuse?
4. **AuthN / AuthZ posture.** High-level: how do you know who someone is, and what they're
   allowed to do? (Deep design is the conditional Identity/auth session — here just the
   stance. Add that row if accounts/login/roles are in scope; mark it `Deferred` with a revisit
   trigger if identity is deliberately pushed to a later phase.)
5. **Secrets & data protection.** Where do secrets live (never in code/repo) and how are
   they rotated? TLS in transit; encryption at rest for sensitive data? **Local dev
   convention:** secrets stay in a gitignored `.env` (values) or `.secrets/` (files like
   certs/keystores); the repo commits only a `.env.example` listing the required keys with
   placeholder values — see `templates/env-example.txt` for the full convention. The
   `.gitignore` stamped by `init.sh` already excludes these — confirm production secrets come
   from a real secrets manager, not a checked-in file. (The rotation posture you set here is
   operationalized in `runbooks/secrets-rotation.md` — rotating on a cadence and responding to a
   suspected leak.)
6. **Common web risks.** Posture on input validation, injection, XSS/CSRF, rate limiting,
   dependency vulnerabilities. What's handled by the framework vs. needs attention? (The
   dependency/supply-chain posture you set here is operationalized in
   `runbooks/dependency-supply-chain.md` — vetting new deps and auditing them on a cadence.)
7. **Mitigate now vs. defer.** For each significant threat: mitigate now, or defer?
   For every deferral, record the blast radius and **what triggers revisiting** (e.g.
   "before we accept real user data / payments / go public"). Add each accepted deferral to
   `registries/risks.yml`, or update the existing row if this session revisits it.
8. **Deferral decision (if applicable).** If you're deferring a full threat model, state it
   explicitly with the trigger to revisit — a conscious, dated decision — and mark substep 1.6
   `Deferred` in the index rather than `Done`.

## Output
Write `architecture/06-security-threat-model.md` — the Security & Threat Model architecture
doc (use `templates/architecture-doc-template.md`). Body:
- **Assets**
- **Trust boundaries** (diagram or list)
- **Threats → mitigations** table — threat | boundary | mitigation | deferred / blast radius
- **AuthN/AuthZ posture**, **secrets & data protection**, **web-risk posture**

Fill the **Decision Summary**, record **Open Questions**, start the **Version Log**. Capture
any contested or deferred decision as an **ADR** (`templates/adr-template.md`) — deferrals especially —
and add each accepted deferral to `registries/risks.yml` with owner, severity, and revisit
trigger. Keep the register row short and reference the architecture section and/or ADR that
records the detail; if neither exists, add the detail to this architecture doc before adding
the register row.
Update `prompts/STEP-index.md`: mark 1.6 `Done` if the threat model is complete, or
`Deferred` if the session deliberately records that a full threat model is not needed yet.
Do not put prose such as "deferred — see ADR-XXXX" in the Status cell; keep the Status cell to
the allowed value and put ADR/risk references in the architecture doc, ADR registry, risk
register, PLAN, or notes/scope text.

## Next
Once 1.6 is marked `Done` or `Deferred`, the next action is the lowest open STEP-1 substep in the index. Tell
the user to **start a fresh chat** and run that substep with a descriptive first message. For
a numbered core session, use `Run STEP-1.N: <Session label from the index>` (for example,
`Run STEP-1.7: UI / Design System`). For a lettered conditional session, use
`Run STEP-1.Xa: <Conditional session label>` and the invocation by name from that
conditional's template. See the next-action resolver in `METHOD.md` §10.

**Begin now — in this same reply.** "STEP-1.N" or "session N.M", with or without a leading "Run" and with or without the session label, is your go-ahead, not a request for acknowledgement: don't say "ready when you are", don't recap this file, don't ask whether to start. Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md` (plus anything relevant in `inputs/` and any earlier architecture docs) silently. Then, in this one reply: **(1)** tell the user — in the one or two sentences from **What this session does** above — what you're about to cover (plain language); then **(2)** immediately **ask decision 1**, calibrated to the profile's experience level. That orientation plus the first question is your entire first reply — nothing more.

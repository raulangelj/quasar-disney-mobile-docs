# quasar-disney-mobile - Interface Contracts (Session 1.11)

> **How to run:** Tell your agent *"STEP-1.11"* or *"session 1.11"*; a leading *"Run"* and
> `: Interface Contracts` are optional (but the label helps chat titles). It interviews you one decision at a
> time, then writes the Interface Contracts architecture doc and updates `prompts/STEP-index.md`.
> Reads `overview.md`, the Architecture Overview architecture doc (`architecture/*-architecture-overview.md`),
> the Data Model architecture doc (`architecture/*-data-model.md`), the Security & Threat Model architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-security-threat-model.md`), the Environments architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-environments.md`), and the Observability architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-observability.md`) first - plus any conditional-session docs already written
> that affect boundaries, identity/auth, privacy, native clients, or data sent to third parties.
> **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Check the **Experience level** in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`: at Level 1-2 (no/basic coding background) explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain language - leading with a recommended default - before asking, and skip bare jargon. If the file is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it, then continue. Also check **Communication style** there and use it as the default level of detail; an explicit style request in chat overrides it for this session only. At any level, treat any confusion or request to clarify - in any words, not just those - as a cue to explain plainly, and tell the user up front they can ask. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

## About quasar-disney-mobile
A mobile app using react native to replicate a streaming applicacion just like Disney+

## What this session does
With the components, data, security, environment decisions, and choices from the Observability
architecture doc in place, we'll decide how system boundaries are specified and kept in sync so
consumers build against a clear contract instead of guessing from prose or code.

Terminology: **Interface Contracts** is the Session 1.11 process name;
`architecture/*-interface-contracts.md` is the **Interface Contracts architecture doc** it
produces (the exact output file is named in the Output section below); an **interface contract artifact**
is a boundary-specific spec or schema named by
that doc, such as OpenAPI, GraphQL, protobuf, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, or a public package
interface.

## Why this session matters
Interfaces are where separately-built pieces most often drift apart: an endpoint changes shape,
an event drops a field, or a generated client no longer matches the service. The Architecture
Overview architecture doc names the boundaries; this session turns the boundary policy into something concrete enough for
implementation STEPs, repo READMEs, check-ins, and CI gates to enforce.

## How this session works
- One decision at a time; **wait** for answers.
- Start from the boundaries named in the Architecture Overview architecture doc, then pull in decisions from data, security/privacy,
  the Environments architecture doc, the Observability architecture doc, and conditionals.
- Keep the right weight for the project: formal contracts for public or cross-component
  boundaries; lightweight or explicitly informal contracts for simple internal seams.

## Decisions to make (in order)
1. **Boundary inventory.** List every boundary that may need a contract: frontend <-> backend,
   mobile/desktop <-> backend, service <-> service, worker/job <-> queue/event bus, public API
   consumers, webhooks, CLI interfaces, library/package public APIs, and data import/export
   formats. Separate **owned interfaces** from third-party APIs this project only consumes.
2. **Contract level per boundary.** For each owned boundary, decide whether it needs a formal
   interface contract artifact, a lightweight Markdown/interface note, or an explicit "informal for now"
   decision. Tiny single-component projects can record that no formal contract is needed yet.
3. **Contract style per boundary.** Choose the style that fits each formal boundary: REST +
   OpenAPI, GraphQL schema, gRPC/protobuf, AsyncAPI/event schema, JSON Schema, typed package
   interfaces, or another established format.
4. **Authoring source vs. consumer contract of record.** Decide how each contract is produced:
   design-first/manual artifact, code-first/generated from annotations or types, hybrid with
   generated output checked in, or explicitly deferred. Name both the **authoring source of
   truth** and the **consumer-facing contract of record**.
5. **Artifact locations.** Decide where interface contract artifacts or planned artifacts live: owning
   repo, docs hub, shared contracts package/repo, per-service `contracts/`, generated docs, or
   a placeholder to create during repo scaffolding when the code repo does not exist yet.
6. **Versioning and compatibility.** Decide URL/path/header versioning, schema/event versioning,
   backward-compatibility rules, deprecation process, consumer migration expectations, and when
   breaking changes are allowed.
7. **Request / message conventions.** For HTTP APIs: path/resource naming, field casing,
   timestamps, IDs, pagination, filtering/sorting, partial updates, idempotency keys, and content
   types. For non-HTTP: message/event naming, envelopes, correlation IDs, retry/idempotency
   semantics, and schema evolution rules.
8. **Error model.** Decide error format, status/code taxonomy, validation error shape,
   auth/permission error posture, and what information must not leak. For HTTP APIs, decide
   whether to use RFC 9457 problem details.
9. **Auth, authorization, and privacy.** Pull from security, identity/auth, and privacy docs:
   auth mechanism, required scopes/roles/permissions, tenant boundaries, personal data in
   payloads, deletion/export endpoints if relevant, and audit-sensitive operations.
10. **Observability hooks.** Pull from the Observability architecture doc: request IDs/correlation
    IDs, trace headers, event IDs, and error logging expectations at boundaries.
11. **Contract testing and CI gates.** Define the contract validation expectations that the Test
    Strategy session will fold into the Test Strategy architecture doc: schema validation, generated client/server tests,
    consumer-driven contract tests if needed, OpenAPI/GraphQL/protobuf linting, backward
    compatibility checks, and what must pass before merge.
12. **Ownership and update rule.** Decide which component/team owns each contract, who reviews
    breaking changes, and the rule for implementation STEPs: any API/interface-changing substep
    updates the interface contract artifact, contract tests, and related README links before it is done.

## Output
Write `architecture/11-interface-contracts.md` — the Interface Contracts architecture doc
(use `templates/architecture-doc-template.md`). Body:
- **Boundary contract inventory** - boundary | owner | contract level | style | status
- **Authoring source and contract of record** - per formal boundary
- **Artifact locations** - including repo-scaffolding placeholders where repos do not exist yet
- **Versioning & compatibility**
- **Request / message conventions**
- **Error model**
- **Auth, authorization & privacy**
- **Observability hooks**
- **Contract testing & CI inputs**
- **Ownership & review**
- **Deferred / informal interfaces**

Write an ADR if the project chooses a significant contract strategy with real tradeoffs
(for example, OpenAPI design-first vs. code-generated, GraphQL vs. REST, or a shared contracts
repo vs. repo-local contracts).

Fill the **Decision Summary**, record **Open Questions**, start the **Version Log**. Update
`prompts/STEP-index.md`: mark 1.11 done.

## Next
Once 1.11 is marked done, the next action is the lowest open STEP-1 substep in the index. Tell
the user to **start a fresh chat** and run that substep with a descriptive first message. For
a numbered core session, use `Run STEP-1.N: <Session label from the index>` (for example,
`Run STEP-1.12: Test Strategy`). For a lettered conditional session, use
`Run STEP-1.Xa: <Conditional session label>` and the invocation by name from that
conditional's template. See the next-action resolver in `METHOD.md` section 10.

**Begin now - in this same reply.** "STEP-1.N" or "session N.M", with or without a leading "Run" and with or without the session label, is your go-ahead, not a request for acknowledgement: don't say "ready when you are", don't recap this file, don't ask whether to start. Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md` (plus anything relevant in `inputs/` and any earlier architecture docs) silently. Then, in this one reply: **(1)** tell the user - in the one or two sentences from **What this session does** above - what you're about to cover (plain language); then **(2)** immediately **ask decision 1**, calibrated to the profile's experience level. That orientation plus the first question is your entire first reply - nothing more.

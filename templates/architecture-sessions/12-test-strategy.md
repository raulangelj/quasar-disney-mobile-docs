# quasar-disney-mobile — Test Strategy (Session 1.12)

> **How to run:** Tell your agent *"STEP-1.12"* or *"session 1.12"*; a leading *"Run"* and
> `: Test Strategy` are optional (but the label helps chat titles). It interviews you one decision at a
> time, then writes the Test Strategy architecture doc and updates `prompts/STEP-index.md`.
> Reads `overview.md`, the Architecture Overview architecture doc (`architecture/*-architecture-overview.md`),
> the Data Model architecture doc (`architecture/*-data-model.md`), the Environments architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-environments.md`), and the Interface Contracts architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-interface-contracts.md`) first — plus any conditional-session
> doc that adds test surface (e.g. identity-auth for authn/authz flows, privacy-compliance for
> data-handling/retention, native-app for device/platform testing, or one added later), if it's
> been written.
> **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Check the **Experience level** in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`: at Level 1-2 (no/basic coding background) explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain language - leading with a recommended default - before asking, and skip bare jargon. If the file is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it, then continue. Also check **Communication style** there and use it as the default level of detail; an explicit style request in chat overrides it for this session only. At any level, treat any confusion or request to clarify - in any words, not just those - as a cue to explain plainly, and tell the user up front they can ask. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

## What this session does
With the components, data, environment decisions, and interface contracts set, we'll decide what kinds
of tests you'll write and what has to pass before code merges, so you can change things later
without fear.

Terminology: **Test Strategy** is the Session 1.12 process name;
`architecture/*-test-strategy.md` is the **Test Strategy architecture doc** it produces (the
exact output file is named in the Output section below); **test artifacts** are concrete files
or configured checks governed by that doc, such as test suites, CI workflows/gates, coverage
reports, and the coding standards files reconciled during this session.

## Why this session matters
Tests are what let you (and your AI agent) change code later without fear. The common
failure modes: no tests, only happy-path tests, or a slow flaky suite no one trusts.
Deciding the **test tiers, what each covers, and what gates a merge** now means quality is
built in rather than bolted on — and it's especially important in a multi-repo project
where the pieces have to work *together*.

## How this session works
- One decision at a time; **wait** for answers.
- Recommend a pragmatic default (a healthy **test pyramid**: many fast unit tests, fewer
  integration, a thin layer of end-to-end) and flag where this system needs more.
- Tie back to the components, data, environment decisions, and interface contracts.

## Decisions to make (in order)
1. **Test tiers.** Define unit / integration / end-to-end for this project: what each
   covers and roughly the balance between them.
2. **What must be covered.** The critical paths and risky areas that must have tests (not a
   vanity coverage percentage). What's explicitly *not* worth testing heavily. As a rough guide you
   can *aim* for ~80% unit-test coverage — a suggestion to steer by, not a gate; don't chase
   the number at the expense of testing what matters.
3. **Test data & isolation.** How tests get data (fixtures/factories) and stay isolated
   (e.g. a fresh DB/schema per test run) so they don't interfere.
4. **Mocking strategy.** What to mock (external/third-party dependencies) vs. exercise for
   real (your own components, a real local DB).
5. **System / end-to-end tests.** How the whole system is tested together — important for
   multi-repo. Where do cross-repo e2e tests live (often a dedicated tests repo)?
6. **CI gates.** What must pass before code merges and before it deploys (tests, linters,
   type checks, build). Keep the gate fast enough that people don't route around it. A starter
   wiring this up ships in `templates/ci/` (a method-integrity workflow that runs
   `scripts/check.sh`, plus a per-repo test workflow to fill in) — see `templates/ci/README.md`.
   Include the contract-validation gates chosen in the Interface Contracts architecture doc where they apply.
7. **Coverage tooling and reporting.** For each real implementation language, choose the
   coverage tool and where its report appears. Default durable coverage/test summaries to
   `reports/test-results/` in the docs hub for meaningful runs such as check-ins, releases,
   incidents, security reviews, major quality-gate changes, or when requested by a user. Keep
   generated multi-file HTML trees as CI artifacts, coverage-service output, or ignored local output by default; only define
   a docs-retained artifact convention when the project has a real release, audit, or compliance
   reason. Treat coverage as a visibility/trend signal, not proof of quality; decide whether
   there is a minimum threshold, changed-lines threshold, or no numeric gate. Good defaults:
   Python `coverage.py` via `pytest-cov`; Java JaCoCo via Maven/Gradle; TypeScript/JavaScript
   Vitest/Jest coverage with V8 or Istanbul/nyc; Go `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`;
   Rust `cargo llvm-cov` (or `grcov`/`tarpaulin` when it fits better); Dart/Flutter
   `dart test --coverage` / `flutter test --coverage` with LCOV output; C#/.NET Coverlet or
   `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`. For substantial shell scripts, consider
   `kcov`; for SQL, prefer migration/query tests or DB-specific tools such as pgTAP/tSQLt
   rather than pretending there is universal line coverage; for APIs, track contract/e2e
   coverage with OpenAPI/GraphQL/protobuf validation and tools such as Schemathesis, Dredd, or
   Newman-style checks.
8. **Performance / load testing.** Whether and when load tests run (ties to the performance
   targets in the Scaling & Performance architecture doc).
9. **Coding standards per language.** Confirm the implementation language(s) from the
   high-level stack (the Architecture Overview architecture doc's stack decision). Then reconcile `coding-standards/` to that list, **one
   language at a time**:
   - **If a `coding-standards/<lang>.md` already ships** (e.g. `python.md`, `typescript.md`,
     `go.md`, `rust.md`, `dart.md`, `java.md`, `csharp.md`): tell the user it exists as a *default starting point*,
     and ask them to review it and flag anything they want changed for this project. Apply
     their edits.
   - **If there's no file for that language:** create one by copying the structure of an
     existing standard (e.g. `coding-standards/python.md`) — same sections (naming, layout,
     error handling, logging, testing) — and fill it in with the user.
   - **Prune** the default standards for languages this project won't use.
   - **`sql.md`, `shell.md`, and `api.md` are cross-cutting**, not 1.3 implementation languages:
     keep `sql.md` if the project uses a relational database, `shell.md` if it ships shell scripts
     (CI glue, dev scripts, entrypoints), and `api.md` if any boundary from the Architecture Overview architecture doc is an HTTP/REST API
     it exposes or consumes — regardless of the language list; prune any that don't apply.
     `sql.md`'s rules are secondary to the language docs where they conflict; `api.md` is the house
     style that complements the HTTP/REST interface contract artifacts and policy from the Interface Contracts architecture doc.

## Output
Write `architecture/12-test-strategy.md` — the Test Strategy architecture doc (use
`templates/architecture-doc-template.md`). Body:
- **Test tiers** — tier | scope | tools | where it runs
- **Coverage priorities** — must-cover paths
- **Coverage tooling and reporting** — language/surface | tool | durable summary location
  (default: `reports/test-results/`) | generated artifact location | threshold/gate
- **Test data & isolation**, **mocking strategy**
- **System/e2e testing** (and its home in a multi-repo setup)
- **CI gates** — what blocks merge / deploy
- **Coding standards** — link the per-language file(s) in `coding-standards/` that apply

When durable Markdown summaries are written, start them from
`templates/reports/test-results/test-results-summary-template.md`.

Also reconcile the `coding-standards/` directory itself (decision 9): keep and user-review
the standards for the chosen languages, add any missing ones from the existing pattern, and
delete the rest. Update the file table in `coding-standards/README.md`.

Fill the **Decision Summary**, record **Open Questions**, start the **Version Log**. Update
`prompts/STEP-index.md`: mark 1.12 done.

## Next
Once 1.12 is marked done, the next action is the lowest open STEP-1 substep in the index. Tell
the user to **start a fresh chat** and run that substep with a descriptive first message. For
a numbered core session, use `Run STEP-1.N: <Session label from the index>` (for example,
`Run STEP-1.13: Glossary`). For a lettered conditional session, use
`Run STEP-1.Xa: <Conditional session label>` and the invocation by name from that
conditional's template. See the next-action resolver in `METHOD.md` §10.

**Begin now — in this same reply.** "STEP-1.N" or "session N.M", with or without a leading "Run" and with or without the session label, is your go-ahead, not a request for acknowledgement: don't say "ready when you are", don't recap this file, don't ask whether to start. Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md` (plus anything relevant in `inputs/` and any earlier architecture docs) silently. Then, in this one reply: **(1)** tell the user — in the one or two sentences from **What this session does** above — what you're about to cover (plain language); then **(2)** immediately **ask decision 1**, calibrated to the profile's experience level. That orientation plus the first question is your entire first reply — nothing more.

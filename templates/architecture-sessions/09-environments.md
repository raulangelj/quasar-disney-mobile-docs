# quasar-disney-mobile — Environments (Session 1.9)

> **How to run:** Tell your agent *"STEP-1.9"* or *"session 1.9"*; a leading *"Run"* and
> `: Environments` are optional (but the label helps chat titles). It interviews you one decision at a
> time, then writes the Environments architecture doc and updates `prompts/STEP-index.md`.
> Reads `overview.md` and the Infrastructure & Deployment architecture doc
> (`architecture/*-infrastructure-deployment.md`) first.
> **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Check the **Experience level** in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`: at Level 1-2 (no/basic coding background) explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain language - leading with a recommended default - before asking, and skip bare jargon. If the file is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it, then continue. Also check **Communication style** there and use it as the default level of detail; an explicit style request in chat overrides it for this session only. At any level, treat any confusion or request to clarify - in any words, not just those - as a cue to explain plainly, and tell the user up front they can ask. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

## What this session does
Building on the Infrastructure & Deployment decisions, we'll define your environments and how config and
secrets differ between them, so untested code and leaked keys don't reach users.

Terminology: **Environments** is the Session 1.9 process name;
`architecture/*-environments.md` is the **Environments architecture doc** it produces (the
exact output file is named in the Output section below); **environment artifacts** are
concrete files, settings, and operational conventions governed by that doc, such as
`.env.example`, gitignored local `.env` / `.secrets/`, secrets-manager entries, seed data,
staging/pre-prod setup, and promotion rules.

## Why this session matters
Most early projects have exactly two environments — "my machine" and "production" — and
push straight from one to the other. That's how untested code and leaked secrets reach
users. Deciding your **environments, how config and secrets differ across them, and how
code is promoted** gives you a safe path to production.

## How this session works
- One decision at a time; **wait** for answers.
- Recommend the **fewest environments that give you safety** for a first release (often local +
  one staging + prod), and flag what each adds in cost/maintenance.

## Decisions to make (in order)
1. **Which environments.** Local/dev, CI (for automated tests), staging/pre-prod,
   production. Which do you actually need for a first release, and what is each *for*?
2. **Sandbox / demo environment?** Do you need a separate sandbox — for trying the product
   without real data, for demos, or for external integrators to test against? (Often *not*
   needed at a first release; decide consciously.)
3. **Config & secrets per environment.** How configuration differs per environment
   (environment variables / config files — never secrets in code) and where each environment's
   secrets come from
   (consistent with the Security & Threat Model architecture doc and the Infrastructure &
   Deployment architecture doc). **Local dev**
   uses a gitignored `.env` (values) / `.secrets/`
   (files) with a committed `.env.example` documenting the keys — see
   `templates/env-example.txt` for the convention (the `init.sh` `.gitignore` already excludes
   these); **deployed environments** pull secrets from a secrets manager, not a file.
4. **Data per environment.** Seed/fixture data for local & CI; is staging data synthetic or
   a prod-like (scrubbed) copy?
5. **Parity.** How close each environment is to production, and where it deliberately
   differs (and the risk that creates).
6. **Promotion flow.** How code and config move between environments (e.g. merge → deploy
   to staging → verify → promote to prod). Who can deploy to each.
7. **Access control.** Who can read/modify each environment, especially production.

## Output
Write `architecture/09-environments.md` (use `templates/architecture-doc-template.md`). Body:
- **Environments table** — environment | purpose | who has access | data
- **Sandbox decision** (needed or not, and why)
- **Config & secrets** per environment
- **Parity & promotion flow**

Fill the **Decision Summary**, record **Open Questions**, start the **Version Log**. Update
`prompts/STEP-index.md`: mark 1.9 done.

## Next
Once 1.9 is marked done, the next action is the lowest open STEP-1 substep in the index. Tell
the user to **start a fresh chat** and run that substep with a descriptive first message. For
a numbered core session, use `Run STEP-1.N: <Session label from the index>` (for example,
`Run STEP-1.10: Observability`). For a lettered conditional session, use
`Run STEP-1.Xa: <Conditional session label>` and the invocation by name from that
conditional's template. See the next-action resolver in `METHOD.md` §10.

**Begin now — in this same reply.** "STEP-1.N" or "session N.M", with or without a leading "Run" and with or without the session label, is your go-ahead, not a request for acknowledgement: don't say "ready when you are", don't recap this file, don't ask whether to start. Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md` (plus anything relevant in `inputs/` and any earlier architecture docs) silently. Then, in this one reply: **(1)** tell the user — in the one or two sentences from **What this session does** above — what you're about to cover (plain language); then **(2)** immediately **ask decision 1**, calibrated to the profile's experience level. That orientation plus the first question is your entire first reply — nothing more.

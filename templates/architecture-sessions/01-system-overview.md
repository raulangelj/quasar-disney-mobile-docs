# quasar-disney-mobile — System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals (Session 1.1)

> **How to run:** Tell your agent *"STEP-1.1"* or *"session 1.1"*; a leading *"Run"* and
> `: System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals` are optional (but the label helps chat titles).
> You can also say *"read and run this file"*.
> It interviews you one decision at a time, then writes
> the System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals architecture doc and updates
> `prompts/STEP-index.md`.
> Have `overview.md` (your 1–2 page brief) available — the session starts from it.
> **Already have a product spec, PRD, or requirements doc?** Put it in `inputs/` (or paste it / point me at it in chat and I'll save a copy there); I'll build on it instead of re-asking what it already answers. Inputs are a point-in-time starting point: I read the live ones (not `inputs/archive/`), and where an `architecture/` doc already covers the same ground, it wins.
> **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Check the **Experience level** in root `.throughstone/local-user.md`: at Level 1-2 (no/basic coding background) explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain language - leading with a recommended default - before asking, and skip bare jargon. If the file is missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it, then continue. Also check **Communication style** there and use it as the default level of detail; an explicit style request in chat overrides it for this session only. At any level, treat any confusion or request to clarify - in any words, not just those - as a cue to explain plainly, and tell the user up front they can ask. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

## About quasar-disney-mobile
A mobile app using react native to replicate a streaming applicacion just like Disney+
<!-- The kickoff fills this from overview.md. Running standalone? Read overview.md first. -->

## What this session does
We'll nail down *what* you're building and — just as important — what you're deliberately
*not* building: the problem, who it's for, how you'll know it works, and what's out of scope.

Terminology: **System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals** is the Session 1.1 process name;
`architecture/*-system-overview.md` is the **System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals
architecture doc** it produces (the exact output file is named in the Output section below);
`overview.md` is the separate kickoff project brief this session reads from. The requirements,
non-goals, success criteria, constraints, assumptions, and risks are sections and decisions
inside the architecture doc, not separate artifacts.

## Why this session matters
This is the foundation every other architecture doc builds on. The two things developers
most often skip:
- **Non-goals.** Writing down what you are *deliberately not* building is what stops scope
  creep. "We'll figure out scope as we go" is how projects never ship.
- **Success criteria.** If you can't state how you'll know it works, you can't tell when
  you're done — or whether it's healthy in production.

No code in this session. The output is a Markdown doc.

## How this session works
1. **One decision at a time.** Ask, show 2–4 concrete options/examples where useful, then
   **wait for the answer**. Don't assume.
2. **Start from what's known.** Pull everything you can from `overview.md` and anything the
   user put in `inputs/` first (its live material, not `inputs/archive/`); ask only what's missing
   or ambiguous. Don't re-ask what the brief or a provided document already answers.
3. **Recommend, then flag the tradeoff.** Where there's a sensible default for a project at
   this stage, propose it — but say what it rules out later.
4. **Push gently on vague answers.** "It should be fast" / "for everyone" → ask for
   something concrete.

## Decisions to make (in order)

### Problem & value
1. **The problem.** In 2–3 sentences: what does quasar-disney-mobile solve, and why now?
2. **Users & stakeholders.** Who are the users or stakeholders? For each main group, what
   problem are they trying to solve? Capture primary personas (1–3) and anyone else affected
   (admins, ops, compliance, your customers' customers).
3. **Success criteria.** How will you know it works? Push for *measurable* outcomes
   ("new user completes X in under N minutes", "handles N requests/day"), not vanity metrics.

### Scope
4. **Core capabilities.** What must the first usable version do? Must-haves only — the
   things without which it isn't the product.
5. **Non-goals.** What are you deliberately NOT doing? Separate "not now" (deferred to a
   later phase) from "not ever" (out of scope by design). *Most important question here.*
6. **Constraints.** Regulatory/compliance, budget, timeline, team size & skills, systems
   you must integrate with or can't change.

### Foundations
7. **Assumptions.** What are you taking as given that, if wrong, would change the design?
   (Expected scale, available infra, third-party reliability, who owns what.)
8. **Key risks & open questions.** What's most likely to go wrong or is still unknown?
   These feed Phasing & Roadmap and the other sessions.

## Output
Write `architecture/01-system-overview.md` — the System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals
architecture doc (use `templates/architecture-doc-template.md`). Body sections, in order:
- **Problem & Value** — the problem statement and why now
- **Users & Stakeholders** — primary personas + others affected
- **Success Criteria** — measurable
- **Scope** — a table with three columns: *Core (in)* | *Not now (deferred)* | *Not ever*
- **Constraints**
- **Assumptions**
- **Risks**

Then fill the **Decision Summary** (all 8 decisions + answers), record any **Open
Questions** for later sessions, and start the **Version Log** at v0.1.0.

Finally, update `prompts/STEP-index.md`: mark substep 1.1 done and note open questions carried
forward. If any decision was significant and contested (e.g. a deliberate "not ever"),
consider capturing it as an ADR using `templates/adr-template.md`.

## Next
Once 1.1 is marked done, **first give the user a quick map of what's ahead** so they have a
sense of the scope before continuing. Build that map from the remaining rows in the
**STEP-1 substeps (architecture sessions)** table in `prompts/STEP-index.md`, not from a
baked-in list here, so added or reordered sessions stay visible automatically. For each
remaining row, give the substep number, session label, and a plain-language phrase for what
it decides; note any rows already marked `Deferred` or `N/A`.

Mention that **conditional** sessions slot in by name when they apply — **identity & auth**
(if there are user accounts / access control), **privacy/compliance** (if there's personal or
regulated data), and **native app** (if there's a mobile or desktop app). The Phasing & Roadmap session
and the index confirm which sessions are in play.

Then point them at the next action: the lowest open STEP-1 substep in the index. Tell the
user to **start a fresh chat** and run that substep with a descriptive first message. For a
numbered core session, use `Run STEP-1.N: <Session label from the index>` (for example,
`Run STEP-1.2: Phasing & Roadmap`). For a lettered conditional session, use
`Run STEP-1.Xa: <Conditional session label>` and the invocation by name from that
conditional's template. See the next-action resolver in `METHOD.md` §10.

**Begin now — in this same reply.** "STEP-1.N" or "session N.M", with or without a leading "Run" and with or without the session label, is your go-ahead, not a request for acknowledgement: don't say "ready when you are", don't recap this file, don't ask whether to start. Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md` (plus anything relevant in `inputs/` and any earlier architecture docs) silently. Then, in this one reply: **(1)** tell the user — in the one or two sentences from **What this session does** above — what you're about to cover (plain language); then **(2)** immediately **ask decision 1**, calibrated to the profile's experience level. That orientation plus the first question is your entire first reply — nothing more.

# quasar-disney-mobile — Agent Context

> **Canonical** context for any AI agent working in this project. The per-machine
> `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root point here. Tool-agnostic: Claude Code,
> Codex, and others read this convention. **New session? Start with "First action — kickoff
> or resume?" just below.**
>
> **Paths in this file are relative to the workspace root** (the folder that contains
> `Code/` and `prompts/`) — that's where your agent runs. Inside the architecture-session and
> template files under `templates/`, paths are instead relative to the docs hub
> (`architecture/…`, `overview.md`), but any reference that crosses repos — notably
> `prompts/STEP-index.md` — is always written in full. (See `METHOD.md` §7, "Path conventions in docs".)

## First action — kickoff or resume?
**Before doing anything else, decide which mode you're in** by reading the `PROJECT-STATUS`
marker near the top of `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md` (the `<!-- PROJECT-STATUS: … -->`
line). It has one of two values:

If `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md` does not exist, this is still the uninitialized
template/download; tell the user to run `./init.sh` first, then come back with *"Read
AGENTS.md and follow it."*

- **`not-started` → Kickoff mode.** The project hasn't been bootstrapped yet. **Begin the
  kickoff now without waiting to be asked**: read `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md`
  and follow it from Stage 0. Greet the user briefly, create/update root
  `.throughstone/local-user.md` from the local-profile questions, and — since `overview.md`
  is still the empty template — **draft the project brief with them in chat** (a couple of
  questions, then you write the first paragraph or two into
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md` for review; seed it from the one-line description in
  *What is quasar-disney-mobile* below). The user should not have to pre-write `overview.md` or paste a
  kickoff command. The bootstrap flips the marker to `kickoff-complete` when it finishes.
- **`kickoff-complete` → Resume mode.** Kickoff already happened. **Do not re-run kickoff.**
  Pick up the next action via the next-action resolver (`METHOD.md` §10): **run
  `./doctor.sh status` (or `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/scripts/status.sh`)** — it resolves §10 mechanically from disk and
  prints where you are, the next action, and the check-in cadence. Read
  `prompts/STEP-index.md` to confirm (and for the sub-STEP detail the script doesn't carry —
  the in-flight PLAN in `Upcoming Prompts/`), then tell the user what's next. If the script
  isn't available (older project, no shell), fall back to reading the index and applying §10
  yourself.

(If the marker is missing entirely — an older project predating it — fall back to inferring:
treat it as resume unless `prompts/STEP-index.md` is still the bare `init.sh` seed.)

## What is quasar-disney-mobile
A mobile app using react native to replicate a streaming applicacion just like Disney+
<!-- Filled during kickoff from overview.md. Keep to a tight paragraph; details live in
     the architecture docs. -->

## How this project is built
This project follows the method in **`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/METHOD.md`** — read it. In short:
- Work is **Phase ▸ STEP ▸ substep**. Phase 1 is the first milestone (an MVP for a new build). STEP numbers are global.
- Not every change is a STEP. Small, well-understood, low-risk tickets or fixes can use the
  normal issue/branch/PR/test/commit flow. Promote to a STEP when the work needs planning,
  sequencing, coordination, architecture/doc review, or durable context for a future agent.
- **STEP-1 is architecture-first**: design docs + ADRs, *no application code*.
- Durable docs live in `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/`:
  - `architecture/` — *what* the system is (versioned, living).
  - `adr/` — *why* it's that way (point-in-time decision records).
  - `inputs/` — point-in-time documents *you* provide that inform the design (specs, prior docs, UI designs); sessions read the live ones here (not `inputs/archive/`) and treat them as a starting point, not living truth (see the inputs rule under Ground rules).
- The roadmap and status are in `prompts/STEP-index.md`.

## Architecture sessions  (how to run one)
When the user says **"STEP-1.N"** or **"session N.M"**, with or without a leading "Run" and
with or without the session label (preferred with the label, e.g.
*"Run STEP-1.1: System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals"*), read the matching file in
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/architecture-sessions/NN-*.md` and follow it exactly:
interview the user one decision at a time, then write the output architecture doc and update
`prompts/STEP-index.md`. No copy-paste, no special commands.

**"STEP-1.N", "Run STEP-1.N: <session label>", "session N.M", and "Run session N.M:
<session label>" are all the user's go-ahead — begin in that same reply.** Don't
acknowledge, summarize the file, restate the plan, or ask whether to start (no "Ready when
you are"). Read root `.throughstone/local-user.md`, `overview.md`, anything relevant in `inputs/` (its live
material, not `inputs/archive/`), and
any earlier architecture docs silently, then immediately **ask the session's first question**,
calibrated to the profile's experience level. The user types one short command and expects
the first question back, not a confirmation prompt.

**Conditional sessions** are invoked **by name**, not by number: *"run the identity-auth
session"* → `conditional-identity-auth.md`; *"run the native-app session"* →
`conditional-native-app.md`; *"run the privacy session"* (or *"run the privacy-compliance
session"*) → `conditional-privacy-compliance.md`.
They're slotted into STEP-1 under a lettered substep (e.g.
`1.6a`, `1.7a`), so if the index's next open substep has a letter suffix, run the matching
`conditional-*.md` by topic rather than looking for a `NN-*.md` file for that number. Each
conditional has an owning session that decides it when the needed facts exist: Native app in
1.3, Privacy/compliance from Data Model / Security, and Identity/auth from Security. A
periodic check-in may also schedule a conditional later as a standalone
`Conditional session: <topic>` follow-up STEP; in that mode, read its active PLAN for the
exact invocation and output-doc number instead of reopening STEP-1.

Each session reads what it needs from disk (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md`, anything
relevant in `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/` excluding `inputs/archive/`, and earlier architecture
docs), so context can be cleared between sessions — state lives in files. If the user provides a document in chat, save
a copy into `inputs/` so later sessions and fresh chats can use it.

When STEP-1 is complete (the Cross-Cutting Review passed), the user moves into building by
saying **"run the planning session"** — read
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/planning-session.md` and follow it: it turns the locked
architecture into the Phase-1 implementation STEPs.

## Implementation STEPs  (how to start one)
For implementation STEPs (`STEP-2` and later), a whole-STEP command such as **"run STEP 6"**,
**"run STEP-6"**, **"start STEP 6"**, **"kick off STEP 6"**, or **"do STEP 6"** means:
plan that STEP, then stop for user approval.

For a `Planned` implementation STEP, confirm the scope, author the STEP PLAN and any substep
prompts using `prompts/README.md` ("Recipe: adding a new STEP"), update
`prompts/STEP-index.md`, then present the plan and ask for approval before running any
substep. **Do not interpret a whole-STEP command as permission to execute the substeps you just
created.** Execution starts only when the user explicitly says **"run substep N.M"** (or gives
an equally specific substep command).

For an `In progress` implementation STEP, open its PLAN in `Upcoming Prompts/`, identify the
lowest open substep, and wait for the user's explicit substep command unless the current
message already names that substep. Never run multiple substeps from a whole-STEP command.

## Repos & workspace layout
This is a **multi-repo** project. The workspace root is **not** a repo — it's a per-machine
shell. (Mono-repo-for-now is the exception — then the root *is* the single repo and the
pointers are committed files; see `METHOD.md` §7.) The repos are siblings:
- `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/` — the docs hub (this repo). All durable content lives here.
- `prompts/` — `prompts/STEP-index.md` roadmap + archived STEP plans/substep prompts.
- `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-*` — code repos, created as the architecture names them.

`registries/repos.yml` is the canonical inventory **and the index to the repos** — each
entry points to a repo whose **README is its "about"** (what it is, how to set it up; plus an
`ARCHITECTURE.md` if it has deep internals). **Before working in a repo, read its README
first** — the same way you read the architecture docs before a design change.
When creating an application-code repo, also apply the project-license posture recorded at
bootstrap by running
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/scripts/apply-project-license.sh <new-repo-path>`. The authoritative
selection is in `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/.throughstone/project-license`; the helper validates
that selection against the docs hub's canonical `LICENSE`, copies the project license unchanged
for open-source projects, and creates no project `LICENSE` for proprietary projects. It also
copies `LICENSE-THROUGHSTONE` because the standard generated repo retains Throughstone-authored
README and CI scaffolding, and writes `LICENSING.md` to make those scopes explicit.
`scripts/setup-workspace.sh` sets up a new developer's machine (clones the siblings, writes
the root pointers). From the workspace root, `./doctor.sh status`, `./doctor.sh check`, and
`./doctor.sh links` are thin shortcuts to the docs hub's `scripts/status.sh`,
`scripts/check.sh`, and `scripts/links.sh`.
New human or agent contributor joining an existing project? Read
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/ONBOARDING.md` for the ordered setup and first-contribution STEP path.
It covers later contributor onboarding; initial project bootstrap still starts from `./init.sh`.

**Workspace-root hygiene:** the workspace root should contain only per-machine pointers
and config (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.throughstone/`), the root helper
(`doctor.sh`), the repo folders (`Code/*`, `prompts/`), and the `Upcoming Prompts/` working
folder (scratch for the in-flight STEP). If you create
or find any *other* file at the workspace root, **ask whether it belongs in a repo** —
durable content almost always belongs in `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/`.

## Ground rules
- **Calibrate to the local user profile.** Before asking user-facing questions or
  explaining a decision, read root `.throughstone/local-user.md` and use its recorded
  **Experience level** and **Communication style** as the communication baseline. This file
  is personal local state; don't duplicate its values into STEP plans or prompts. If it is
  missing, ask the two local-profile questions from `BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` Stage 0, create it,
  and continue. An explicit style request in chat overrides the profile for the current
  session only; edit `.throughstone/local-user.md` to change future defaults.
- **Use judgment before creating a STEP.** For tiny, well-understood changes that do not affect
  architecture, public contracts, data model, security posture, deployment behavior, multiple
  repos, or accepted risk/debt, keep the record in the issue/PR/commit trail instead of adding
  process overhead.
- During the architecture STEP, produce **Markdown docs + ADRs only — no code**.
- Significant decisions become **ADRs** (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/adr-template.md`); never
  rewrite an accepted ADR's decision — supersede it or append an amendment.
- **Keep the docs true.** When implementation changes an architecture decision, update the
  affected `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/architecture/NN-*.md` and bump its Version Log, or write an
  ADR. New code counts too: a new component or repo may need the Architecture Overview
  architecture doc (`architecture/*-architecture-overview.md`) / `registries/repos.yml`, and
  a new domain term may need the Glossary architecture doc — don't let a doc go stale (see
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/METHOD.md` §6).
- **Inputs are point-in-time; `architecture/` is the living truth.** Treat anything in
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/` as a *starting point*, not a current source of truth: where a
  generated `architecture/` or `adr/` doc covers the same ground, the generated doc wins, and an
  input's superseded parts must not be built on. `inputs/inputs-index.md` records what each input
  still holds vs. what's been superseded; **read `inputs/` but not `inputs/archive/`** (retired
  inputs, kept for history). When a session captures an input's content into `architecture/`, mark
  it in that index. **Lift architecture-grade inputs — a protocol/API spec, a formal contract, a
  finished design doc — into `architecture/` promptly** (often a whole-file copy or a light reformat
  to match doc conventions), rather than leaving them live here with `architecture/` merely pointing
  at them; the original stays as provenance. (Use judgment, though: some inputs are better
  **referenced** from `architecture/` and kept here long-lived — a large external standard you only
  partially implement is one example, not the only one.) The
  periodic check-in reconciles the ledger and retires fully-superseded inputs
  (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/README.md`).
- **Keep accepted risks visible.** Known, accepted risks and deferred technical debt live in
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/registries/risks.yml`. Add or update a row when security controls,
  dependency fixes, incident follow-ups, or tech debt are consciously deferred. The register is
  an index: reference the architecture decision/section, ADR, issue/follow-up STEP, incident
  report under `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/reports/incidents/`, or check-in report under
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/reports/` that carries the details; create that source first if it
  doesn't exist.
- **Document code as you write it.** Every class, function, and method gets a docstring;
  comment the *why* of non-obvious logic (see
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/coding-standards/README.md`).
- **Suggest a check-in about every 20 STEPs (the project's cadence, adjustable).** When about that
  many STEPs have passed since the last check-in, proactively propose inserting a **Check-in STEP** that runs
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/runbooks/check-in.md` (doc-drift reconciliation both ways,
  conditional-session coverage, accepted-risk review, and a full test run). See `METHOD.md`
  §5.
- **Flag milestone docs at a phase/release.** When a phase completes or you cut a release,
  proactively ask the user about **release notes** and **user-facing doc updates** — neither
  is produced by normal STEP work. If the user wants release notes, start from
  `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/release-notes-template.md`; end-user docs are otherwise outside this
  method's scope (see `METHOD.md` §5, *Milestone doc review*).
- **Never commit secrets.** Local dev values live in a gitignored `.env` / `.secrets/`;
  commit only a `.env.example` that documents the required keys.
- Keep **`prompts/STEP-index.md`** current — it's the source of truth for status.
- **Treat STEP-1 as the bootstrap special case.** `init.sh` seeds `STEP-1` as `Planned`; the
  kickoff creates the STEP-1 PLAN. When kickoff closes, flip `STEP-1` to `In progress` and use
  `step-0001-architecture` wherever branch-per-STEP applies.
- **Always say what's next.** End every session/STEP by updating the index, then tell the
  user the next action and to **start a fresh chat** for it. Answer *"what do I do next?"* by
  running `./doctor.sh status` (or `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/scripts/status.sh`) — it runs the **next-action resolver**
  (`METHOD.md` §10) mechanically from disk (where you are · next action · check-in cadence) —
  then confirming against `prompts/STEP-index.md`. From disk, never from memory.
- One decision/question cluster at a time. Recommend defaults; flag what they foreclose.

## Working alongside others (humans or other agents)
Full conventions are in `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/runbooks/collaboration.md` — read it before any
STEP when more than one contributor is active. The rules that bind you as an agent:
- **One owner per STEP.** A STEP and all its substeps have a single owner — substeps aren't
  split across people. If work needs to split, make it separate STEPs.
- **Every STEP is worked on a branch** named `step-NNNN-short-name` — the same name in every
  repo it touches. Do this even solo.
- **Reserve the STEP number before working.** Pull `prompts/`, take `max + 1`, add the row to
  `prompts/STEP-index.md` **on `prompts/`'s shared trunk** (never a `step-NNNN` branch), then **commit
  and push immediately** (a dedicated `reserve STEP-N` commit) — before you branch or write. If
  the push is rejected, pull, renumber, push again. After any pull/merge — even a clean one,
  which merges two appended rows into a silent duplicate that no conflict flags — scan before
  pushing and renumber if it's non-empty:
  `grep -oE '^\|[[:space:]]*STEP-[0-9]+' prompts/STEP-index.md | grep -oE 'STEP-[0-9]+' | sort | uniq -d`.
- **Read the index first and warn on overlap.** The shared index row is the coordination
  surface. Before starting, compare the `Repos (projection)` of **in-flight** STEPs
  (`In progress`, plus any `Planned` row with a live `step-*` branch) against your scope; if
  they overlap, tell the user — then proceed (it's a heads-up, not a block). A *remote*
  `git ls-remote --heads origin 'step-*'` scan is an optional extra **only if** the team pushes
  its step branches — a local `git branch --list` never sees a teammate's branch.
- **Flip your STEP's row to `In progress` when you start** (right after cutting the branch) and
  **push the flip to the shared trunk** — reservation leaves it `Planned`, and a STEP left at
  `Planned` (or whose flip is unpushed) while you work is invisible to everyone else's overlap
  check.
- **Edit only your own rows** in shared table files (`prompts/STEP-index.md`, `adr/README.md`, phase
  `README.md`, `registries/repos.yml`); never re-sort or reflow them.
- **Significant decisions in a team land as `Proposed` ADRs**, accepted by the designated
  authority (see `adr/README.md`) — don't silently Accept a decision others depend on.
- **Reserve the ADR number like a STEP number.** The `adr/README.md` registry is shared, so
  two authors can append the same `ADR-NNNN` and git merges both into a silent duplicate. Pull,
  take `max + 1`, add the row and create the ADR file, then **commit and push immediately**;
  before every push (even a clean merge) scan with
  `grep -oE '^\|[[:space:]]*ADR-[0-9]+' adr/README.md | grep -oE 'ADR-[0-9]+' | sort | uniq -d`, and if it's non-empty or the push is
  rejected, recompute `max + 1`, renumber, and push again. See `runbooks/collaboration.md` §6.

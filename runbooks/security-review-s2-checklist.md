# S2 Checklist - Security Audit

Use this checklist when running **S2 - Security Audit** from
[`security-review.md`](security-review.md). S2 is a deeper structured review against the
external security frameworks and threat areas that apply to the project. It is strongly
recommended before public launch, before sensitive production use, after major security-posture
changes, after serious incidents, and on the chosen cadence for high-risk production systems.

S2 is not "run every checklist." It is an applicability-driven audit. Select the modules that
match the project's architecture, data, users, deployment model, and risk. Record why modules
were included, deferred, or marked not applicable.

## How S2 Differs From S0 And S1

- **S0** checks whether the project has baseline guardrails: repository hygiene, CI/security
  tooling, secret scanning, dependency alerts, artifact scanning, and operational readiness.
- **S1** checks drift since the last review: advisories, stale risks, changed surfaces, and
  security-sensitive implementation changes.
- **S2** evaluates whether the system's design, implementation, supply chain, operations, and
  secure-development practices stand up against the applicable frameworks.

OWASP Top 10 is useful, but it is not enough for S2. Treat it as an awareness baseline for web
applications. Use ASVS, API Security Top 10, Mobile Top 10, LLM/GenAI guidance, CWE, SSDF,
SAMM, CIS, SLSA, SBOM, cloud posture, and operational modules where they match the system.

## Outcome Values

Use exactly one outcome for every applicable checklist row:

| Outcome | Meaning | Minimum record |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Pass | Reviewed and no material gap was found for this audit scope. | Evidence, date, reviewer, framework/control reference where useful. |
| Partial | Some controls are present, but coverage is incomplete or unverified. | Gap, impact, owner, follow-up STEP/issue or risk ref. |
| Gap | A material weakness, missing control, or untested security assumption was found. | Finding, severity, affected scope, owner, required fix or accepted-risk decision. |
| Fixed during audit | A small, low-risk issue was corrected during the audit. | Change made, evidence, commit/PR if available. |
| Follow-up STEP | Non-trivial work is needed outside the audit. | STEP/issue ref, owner, severity, target trigger/date. |
| Accepted Risk | The team accepts the risk or a longer deferral. | `registries/risks.yml` ref, owner, reason, revisit trigger. |
| Specialist review | The area needs an external, domain-specific, legal, compliance, privacy, cloud, AI, mobile, or penetration-testing review. | Scope, owner, trigger/date, vendor or process if known. |
| Incident | Active compromise, serious exposure, malicious dependency, or urgent exploited vulnerability. | Switch to `incident-postmortem.md`; record incident report ref. |
| N/A | The item does not apply to the project in its current shape. | Reason and trigger that would make it applicable if useful. |

## Severity Values

Use these severity labels for findings. Projects may add CVSS, EPSS, exploitability, business
impact, or customer impact fields, but keep this minimum vocabulary stable:

| Severity | Use when |
|----------|----------|
| Critical | Likely or confirmed compromise, unauthenticated privileged access, broad sensitive-data exposure, exploitable supply-chain compromise, payment/regulatory emergency, or no credible mitigation for a high-impact path. |
| High | Plausible exploitation of sensitive data, tenant boundaries, admin functions, production secrets, build/release integrity, payment/regulated flows, or high-value AI/tool actions. |
| Medium | Meaningful weakness with compensating controls, limited blast radius, or exploitation requiring unusual preconditions. |
| Low | Localized hardening issue, defense-in-depth gap, missing documentation, or low-impact configuration weakness. |
| Info | Useful observation, future trigger, or documentation/process improvement without current material risk. |

## Evidence Rules

- Prefer durable evidence: architecture docs, ADRs, interface contracts, threat model sections,
  test results, scanner reports, audit logs, access-control matrices, deployment/IaC settings,
  cloud dashboards, CI workflow files, package metadata, SBOMs, provenance attestations, and
  command output summaries.
- Do not paste secrets, private tokens, customer data, exploit payloads, sensitive logs, or
  detailed infrastructure internals into the report. Reference the secure system that holds
  them.
- When using external standards, record the version/date checked because security frameworks
  change. Prefer current primary sources.
- Use `registries/risks.yml` for accepted security risks, meaningful deferrals, and monitoring
  items. The S2 report may summarize the decision, but the durable risk/debt index lives there.
- Update architecture docs only if reality or intended posture changed. Do not edit them merely
  to say that the audit happened.
- If the audit reveals active compromise, serious exposure, a malicious dependency, or urgent
  exploited vulnerability, stop normal S2 handling and move to incident response.

## Framework Reference Set

Verify current versions when the audit runs. This scaffold starts from the following public
frameworks and guidance. Use only the references that match the project and add project-specific
standards when needed.

- **OWASP Top 10 2025** (<https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/>) is an awareness baseline
  for common web application risk classes. It is not a full audit standard by itself.
- **OWASP API Security Top 10 2023** (<https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/>) applies
  to API-heavy systems, public APIs, partner APIs, and internal service APIs with meaningful
  trust boundaries.
- **OWASP ASVS** (<https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/>)
  is the more rigorous application-security verification checklist. Choose Level 1, 2, or 3
  based on project risk.
- **OWASP SAMM** (<https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/>) reviews secure-development maturity
  across governance, design, implementation, verification, and operations.
- **CWE Top 25** (<https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/>) helps target implementation review, tests,
  and secure-code hardening at common weakness classes.
- **CIS Controls v8.1** (<https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8-1>) covers operational
  security hygiene such as inventory, access control, secure configuration, logging, recovery,
  and vulnerability management.
- **NIST SSDF v1.1 / SP 800-218** (<https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final>) checks secure
  software development practices: prepare, protect software, produce well-secured software, and
  respond to vulnerabilities.
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0** (<https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework>) is useful for
  broader governance, risk, identify/protect/detect/respond/recover posture.
- **SLSA v1.2** (<https://slsa.dev/>) covers build integrity, provenance, source/build
  isolation, and supply-chain assurance.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** (<https://scorecard.dev/>) gives repository and dependency hygiene
  signals for open-source or shared-source repos.
- **SBOM formats and tooling** such as CycloneDX (<https://cyclonedx.org/>) and SPDX
  (<https://spdx.dev/>) support component inventory for distribution, incident response,
  vulnerability response, and enterprise/customer assurance.
- **OWASP Mobile Top 10 2024** (<https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/>) applies to
  native or hybrid mobile apps, mobile SDKs, mobile API clients, and app-store distributed
  clients.
- **OWASP LLM / GenAI guidance** (<https://genai.owasp.org/>) applies to LLM, agent, RAG,
  tool-calling, prompt-injection, model-mediated decision, and model supply-chain surfaces.

## Module Selection

Start every S2 with scoping, then choose modules. Record each selected module in the report's
module-selection table with one disposition: **In scope**, **Deferred**, **Specialist review**,
or **N/A**. Use **Deferred** only when the module applies but is intentionally moved to later
work with an owner and trigger. Use **Specialist review** when normal project review is not
enough and the area needs external/domain expertise. Use **N/A** when the module does not apply
to the current project shape.

Every S2 should include scoping and audit setup, prior reviews/baseline/risk-ledger review, and
threat-model/architecture-posture review. Add the remaining modules only when they match the
project:

- Web application security: public/admin web app, browser client, server-rendered UI, SPA, or
  web session surface. Typical references: OWASP Top 10 and ASVS.
- API and service security: public, partner, mobile, internal, GraphQL, RPC, webhook, or
  service-to-service APIs. Typical references: OWASP API Security Top 10 and ASVS API controls.
- AuthN, AuthZ, session, and tenant isolation: accounts, roles, admins, tenants, service
  accounts, or privileged workflows.
- Data protection and privacy-supporting controls: sensitive, personal, regulated, payment,
  health, financial, confidential, or customer data.
- Secure implementation and CWE review: custom code handles input, parsing, files, auth,
  crypto, concurrency, serialization, memory, commands, or queries.
- Mobile application security: native/hybrid mobile apps, mobile SDKs, mobile local storage,
  mobile auth, or app-store distribution.
- LLM, AI, agent, RAG, and tool-calling security: LLMs, agents, retrieval, prompts, tools,
  model-mediated decisions, embeddings, fine-tuning, or generated code/content.
- Dependency, SBOM, and vulnerability response: third-party packages, containers, images,
  plugins, AI models, datasets, or redistributable artifacts.
- CI/CD, provenance, and software supply chain: automated build, release, packages, containers,
  deploy pipelines, outside contributors, or distributed artifacts.
- Infrastructure, cloud, and operational posture: hosted environments, cloud/IaC, Kubernetes,
  databases, queues, CDN, object storage, DNS, admin consoles, or production operations.
- Secure SDLC, governance, and maturity: production systems, teams, compliance expectations,
  enterprise customers, high-risk cadence, or security program review.
- Specialist penetration test or external assurance: public launch, high-value target,
  regulatory/customer requirement, payments, regulated data, critical infrastructure, or
  untrusted multi-tenant system.

## S2 Checklist

Use these rows as review prompts, not as a table that must be pasted wholesale into the S2
report. Most S2 evidence and judgment will be too long for table cells. In the report, summarize
module status in the compact **Checklist Outcomes** table, then write the detailed evidence,
reasoning, gaps, fixes, accepted risks, and follow-up work in the relevant module prose
sections. Keep a row-level tracker only when the project needs explicit control-by-control
traceability.

Add project-specific prompts when the system has a security-relevant surface not covered by the
starter structure.

## Completion Criteria

An S2 audit is complete when:

- The report records trigger, scope, intentionally skipped areas, reviewer, reviewed commit,
  change markers, selected modules, module dispositions, framework versions/dates checked, and
  next recommended review date or trigger.
- Every selected module has enough evidence for a future reviewer to understand what was
  checked, what was not checked, and why the depth was appropriate.
- Applicable findings have severity, affected scope, evidence, owner, required fix or accepted
  risk, target trigger/date, and follow-up STEP/issue when work remains.
- Open security risks in `registries/risks.yml` were reviewed, updated, closed, or promoted to
  follow-up STEPs.
- S0 was run or scheduled if the baseline was missing, stale, or invalidated.
- Non-trivial fixes are tracked as follow-up STEPs or issues, not hidden inside the audit.
- Any active compromise, serious exposure, malicious dependency, or urgent exploited
  vulnerability was moved to incident handling instead of being treated as normal audit work.
- Architecture docs, ADRs, interface contracts, and runbooks were updated only where the
  implemented system or intended posture changed.
- `registries/security-reviews.yml` points to the completed S2 report.

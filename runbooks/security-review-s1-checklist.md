# S1 Checklist — Security Sweep

Use this checklist when running **S1 — Security Sweep** from
[`security-review.md`](security-review.md). S1 is a lightweight recurring review for security
drift, advisories, stale accepted risks, and security-sensitive changes since the last review.

S1 is not the S0 baseline and not the S2 audit. It assumes the project has some recorded intended
posture, usually in the Security & Threat Model architecture doc, and asks whether the current
system still matches it. If S1 finds missing baseline guardrails, create or run an S0 Security
Baseline STEP. If it finds broad uncertainty, high-risk design change, or a review surface too
large for a sweep, create an S2 Security Audit STEP.

## Outcome Values

Use exactly one outcome for every applicable row:

| Outcome | Meaning | Minimum record |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| No issue | Reviewed and no material drift, alert, or action was found. | Evidence, date, reviewer. |
| Fixed during review | A small, low-risk issue was corrected as part of the sweep. | Change made, evidence, commit/PR if available. |
| Follow-up STEP | Non-trivial work is needed outside the sweep. | STEP/issue ref, owner, severity/priority. |
| Accepted Risk | The team accepts the risk or a longer deferral. | `registries/risks.yml` ref, owner, reason, revisit trigger. |
| Escalate S0 | Baseline guardrails are missing, stale, or invalidated. | Security Baseline STEP/issue or reason for immediate S0. |
| Escalate S2 | A deeper audit is needed. | Security Audit STEP/issue and reason. |
| Incident | Active compromise, serious exposure, malicious dependency, or urgent exploited vulnerability. | Switch to `incident-postmortem.md`; record incident report ref. |
| N/A | The item does not apply to the project in its current shape. | Reason, and trigger that would make it applicable if useful. |

## Evidence Rules

- Prefer durable evidence: architecture docs, ADRs, changed files, scanner reports, dependency
  alert dashboards, package audit output, vendor advisories, issue/STEP links, release notes,
  configuration snapshots, or command output summaries.
- Do not paste secrets, private tokens, customer data, exploit payloads, sensitive logs, or
  detailed infrastructure internals into the report. Reference the secure system that holds them.
- When checking public advisory sources, record what source was checked and the date. Use current
  primary or authoritative sources where possible, such as ecosystem advisories, vendor security
  bulletins, OSV/GitHub advisories, and CISA KEV for exploited vulnerabilities.
- Use `registries/risks.yml` for meaningful accepted risks, stale deferrals, or monitoring items.
  The S1 report may summarize the decision, but the durable risk/debt index lives there.
- Update the Security & Threat Model architecture doc only if reality changed. Do not edit it just
  to record that the sweep happened.

## Advisory Sources

Use this as a scaffold starter set, then customize it for the project's actual stack. Do not
turn S1 into a broad threat-intelligence exercise; record the sources that apply, the date
checked, the result, and any follow-up. If a project has configured alerting or scanner
dashboards, those project-specific sources are usually more important than manually browsing a
generic database.

Default sources to consider unless the project records why they are not useful:

| Source | URL | Use when |
|--------|-----|----------|
| CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog | <https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog> | Consider for exploited-in-the-wild vulnerabilities relevant to technologies, products, CI/CD systems, hosting, appliances, and infrastructure in use. |
| OSV.dev | <https://osv.dev/> | Consider for open-source dependency ecosystems; prefer OSV-Scanner or the project's configured dependency audit when available. |
| GitHub Advisory Database | <https://github.com/advisories> | Consider for common package ecosystems, GitHub Actions, and GitHub-hosted dependency alerts. |
| NVD | <https://nvd.nist.gov/> | Use as a cross-reference for CVEs and affected-product metadata; do not rely on it as the only source. |
| CVE.org | <https://www.cve.org/> | Use as the CVE identifier authority and cross-reference when an advisory cites CVEs. |
| Project alert dashboards | Project-specific | Review configured GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket alerts, Dependabot/Renovate/Snyk/OSV-Scanner reports, SAST, container/image scans, cloud posture alerts, and vendor dashboards. |

Stack-specific sources to add when applicable:

| Source | URL | Applies when |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Go Vulnerability Database | <https://pkg.go.dev/vuln> | The project uses Go modules or Go tooling. |
| RustSec Advisory Database | <https://rustsec.org/advisories/> | The project uses Rust crates. |
| Kubernetes official CVE feed | <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed/> | The project deploys to or depends on Kubernetes. |
| AWS Security Bulletins | <https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/> | The project uses AWS-managed services, AMIs, runtimes, or infrastructure. |
| Google Cloud Security Bulletins | <https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins> | The project uses Google Cloud or Firebase services. |
| Microsoft Security Response Center Update Guide | <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide> | The project uses Microsoft, Azure, Windows, .NET, or related platform services. |
| Ubuntu CVE Tracker | <https://ubuntu.com/security/cves> | The project ships, deploys, or builds on Ubuntu images or packages. |
| Debian Security Tracker | <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/> | The project ships, deploys, or builds on Debian images or packages. |
| Alpine secdb | <https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/> | The project ships, deploys, or builds on Alpine images or packages. |
| Red Hat CVE Database | <https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve> | The project uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenShift, Red Hat runtimes, or related Red Hat products. |

Add vendor advisories for any major database, identity provider, payment processor, CDN, queue,
search engine, observability platform, AI provider, framework, hardware appliance, or hosted
integration that is part of the project's security posture.

## Sweep Checklist

Copy the rows into the S1 report, then add project-specific rows for any security-relevant
technology, surface, or integration. Keep non-applicable rows in the report as `N/A` when their
absence is a useful future signal.

| Area | Review item | Outcome | Evidence / notes | Follow-up STEP / issue | Risk ref |
|------|-------------|---------|------------------|------------------------|----------|

## S1 Completion Criteria

An S1 sweep is complete when:

- The report records the trigger, scope, intentionally skipped areas, reviewer, reviewed commit,
  change markers, and next recommended review date or trigger.
- Each applicable checklist row has one of the allowed outcomes and enough evidence for a future
  reviewer to understand the decision.
- Relevant dependency/security alerts, exploited-advisory sources, and vendor/platform advisories
  were checked or explicitly marked unavailable/out of scope.
- Open security risks in `registries/risks.yml` were reviewed, updated, closed, or promoted to
  follow-up STEPs.
- Small low-risk fixes made during the sweep are recorded with evidence.
- Non-trivial work is tracked as follow-up STEPs or issues, not hidden inside the review.
- Any active compromise, serious exposure, malicious dependency, or urgent exploited vulnerability
  was moved to incident handling instead of being treated as normal review work.
- `registries/security-reviews.yml` points to the completed S1 report.

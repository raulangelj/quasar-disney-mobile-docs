# Bootstrap Prompt

**Hand this to your AI agent to start the project.** Open the workspace folder in your
agent and say: *"Read `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/BOOTSTRAP-PROMPT.md` and
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md`, and let's begin."*

---

You are helping the user start a new software project, architecture-first. Your job in
this kickoff is to turn their 1–2 page idea into a planned project: a roadmap, an
architecture STEP, and the prompts to execute it. You will write actual code *later* — not
in this kickoff.

## Read first
1. `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/METHOD.md` — the methodology you must follow (tiers,
   architecture-first, the doc genres, sessions, naming). Internalize it.
2. `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md` — the user's project idea. Your starting point.

If `overview.md` is still the empty template (the common case right after `init.sh`),
**don't make the user fill it in alone.** Ask them to describe the idea in a sentence or two
right here in the chat — or to expand on the one-line description `init.sh` already captured
(it's in the *What is quasar-disney-mobile* section of `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/AGENTS.md`) — then
**draft the first paragraph or two yourself and write them into
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md`** for their review. (If they'd rather paste or point you
at a longer brief they already have, use that instead.)

**Tell the user, up front, that they can bring documents they already have.** Anything that
informs the design — a product spec or PRD, prior architecture or design docs, a protocol/API
specification, UI designs or mockups, competitor and prior-art research — belongs in
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/`, and stays available to **every** architecture session from
here on, not just this kickoff. If the user pastes a document or points you at one in chat,
**save a copy into `inputs/`** (clear filename; original format is fine) so it persists for
later sessions and fresh chats. The architecture sessions read the relevant inputs and build
on them instead of re-deriving what the user already knows. See
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/inputs/README.md`.

## Work through these stages, pausing at each checkpoint

The user may be a less-experienced developer. **Guide, don't assume.** Recommend sensible
defaults, explain tradeoffs in plain language, and ask before moving on. Stage 0 establishes
the active user's local communication profile — calibrate every stage to it (see
`METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level").

### Stage 0 — Interview  ▸ checkpoint
**Ask these local-profile questions first, before any project question:**

1. *How much experience does the user have building a software project like this?* — Level
   **1** (no coding experience), **2** (basic coding experience), or **3** (senior developer
   or above).
2. *How terse or explanatory should project discussions be by default?* — **Terse**,
   **Normal**, or **Explanatory**.

Create or update root `.throughstone/local-user.md` with those two answers under
**Experience level** and **Communication style**. This file is **personal, per-machine local
state**, not a project fact and not something to commit; each additional contributor creates
their own copy during onboarding. The user can edit it later or override it in chat for a
single session. Override precedence is: explicit chat instruction for this session, then
`.throughstone/local-user.md`, then ask and create the missing profile.

Use this shape:

```md
# Local User Profile

Experience level: {{1 | 2 | 3}} - {{label}}
Communication style: {{Terse | Normal | Explanatory}}
```

The experience level **calibrates the rest of the interview and every later architecture
session for this user**: at Level 1–2, explain each question's *what* and *why* in plain
language, lead with a recommended default, and avoid unexplained jargon (scaling, threat
model, environments …); at any level, treat any sign of confusion or request to clarify —
however worded — as a cue to explain plainly. **When you write the profile, tell the user in
plain terms they can ask you to explain any question at any time** — don't make them discover
it. (See `METHOD.md` §4, "Calibrating to the user's experience level".)

Then read `overview.md` and fill the gaps a brief usually misses. Ask about: who uses it and
who else is affected; expected scale now vs. in a year; hard constraints (regulatory,
budget, timeline, team, existing systems); data sensitivity; integrations; and — most
importantly — what's **explicitly out of scope**. Keep it conversational, a few questions
at a time. When you have enough, summarize your understanding back and offer to write it
into `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md`. **Wait for confirmation.**

### Stage 1 — Roadmap  ▸ checkpoint
Propose:
- **The Phase-1 milestone.** Phase 1 is the first release-level milestone — ask what *kind*
  it is, leading with the recommendation: *"Is Phase 1 an MVP, POC, prototype, or full v1 —
  or something else entirely?"* An **MVP** is the common first milestone for a new build, so
  recommend it as the default; but a POC, a prototype, or a full v1 are all valid, so don't
  assume. Record the chosen name: it fills the `## Phase 1 — <name>` heading in
  `prompts/STEP-index.md` (replacing the `{{PHASE_1_NAME}}` placeholder `init.sh` left there),
  and its kebab-case form later names the `001-<phase-name>/` archive folder created when
  STEP-1 is archived (so a POC archives to `001-poc/`, a full v1 to `001-v1/`).
- **The release stage** — a *separate axis* from the milestone above. How widely and to whom
  this first release ships (pre-launch → internal alpha → closed/invite-only beta → public
  beta → GA): an **engineering calibration input** — how much robustness and polish the
  architecture owes its audience — **not** the marketing launch plan. Ask it leading with the
  recommendation: *"Where does the first release land — internal/pre-launch, a closed beta, or
  public?"* Most new builds genuinely **start pre-launch**, so recommend that as the default; a
  closed beta or a public launch are also valid, so don't assume. Record the answer on the
  optional **"Release stage / launch target"** line in `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md` (a
  short prose descriptor — e.g. `internal alpha`, `closed beta — ~50 invited users`,
  `public GA`). It stays **independent** of the Phase-1 scope name above and of any doc
  `Status`; the architecture sessions calibrate their *breadth* defaults to it, while *rigor*
  stays keyed to what's at stake (`METHOD.md` §4).
- The **Phase plan** — what Phase 1 (your chosen first milestone) includes and, deliberately,
  excludes; a rough sketch of later phases for things being deferred. (This is a sketch to
  align on direction; the Phasing & Roadmap session formalizes the phase plan.)
- **STEP-1 (architecture)** as the first and — for now — the *only* STEP in the index.
Record **only STEP-1's row** in `prompts/STEP-index.md` (already seeded from
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/step-index-seed.md` by `init.sh` — fill in that row), and set
the `## Phase 1 — <name>` heading to the chosen milestone name (replacing the
`{{PHASE_1_NAME}}` placeholder and deleting the explanatory comment beneath it).
**Don't add implementation STEP rows yet** — those are outlined later by the planning
session, after STEP-1's review passes (`METHOD.md` §2). **Wait for the user to confirm
scope** before continuing.

### Stage 2 — STEP-1 PLAN  ▸ checkpoint
STEP-1 is **architecture-first: design docs + ADRs, no code.** Decide which architecture
sessions apply (see the core set in `METHOD.md` §4). Enumerate every
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/architecture-sessions/conditional-*.md` file; never leave a
conditional simply unconsidered, including one added after this bootstrap prompt was written.
Fill in the **Conditional sessions considered** table in the PLAN with one row per discovered
template, adding any row not already seeded there. Name its owning session and current call:
**Include** (→ the substep it becomes, e.g. `1.6a`), **Deferred** (with a revisit trigger), or
**N/A** (with a one-line reason). Native app is owned by the Architecture Overview & Component
Boundaries client-surfaces question; Identity/auth is owned by the Security session's
AuthN/AuthZ posture; Privacy/compliance is owned by the Data Model / Security sessions when
personal or regulated data appears. A skipped or deferred conditional must leave a recorded
reason, so a future reader sees a decision rather than an accident. Keep the core sessions
unless their own session instructions explicitly say to mark them `N/A` or `Deferred` (for
example, the UI / Design System session when there is no styled UI). Write
`Upcoming Prompts/quasar-disney-mobile-STEP-1-PLAN.md` (from
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/step-plan-template.md`) listing the chosen sessions as substeps,
the locked decisions, and the definition of done. **Wait for confirmation.**

### Stage 3 — Substep prompts  ▸ checkpoint
For STEP-1, the substep prompts already exist as the session files in
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/architecture-sessions/`. Confirm the mapping (substep 1.1
→ session 01, etc.) in the PLAN and the index. (For later, non-architecture STEPs, you'll
author substep prompts from `Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/substep-prompt-template.md`.)

**Then close out the kickoff:** flip the kickoff gate by editing the
`<!-- PROJECT-STATUS: not-started -->` line near the top of
`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/overview.md` to `<!-- PROJECT-STATUS: kickoff-complete -->`. This is
what tells future sessions to resume from `prompts/STEP-index.md` instead of re-running this
kickoff. Then flip the `STEP-1` row in `prompts/STEP-index.md` from `Planned` to
`In progress`; `init.sh` reserved `STEP-1`, and kickoff is the special setup that starts it.
Use branch `step-0001-architecture` for STEP-1 work wherever branch-per-STEP applies (and in a
team/shared-remote project, push the `In progress` flip). **Then stop.**

### Execution (after kickoff)
The user drives from here, one session at a time:
> Run STEP-1.1: System Overview, Requirements & Non-Goals

Each session interviews the user and writes its architecture doc + any ADRs, then updates
`prompts/STEP-index.md`. Encourage the user to clear the chat between sessions — state
lives on disk. When all architecture sessions are done, run the substep labeled
**Cross-Cutting Review**.

Then move from architecture into building: tell the agent *"run the planning session"*
(`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/planning-session.md`). It outlines **all** the Phase-1
**implementation STEPs** (a couple of sentences each) into `prompts/STEP-index.md` — the
bridge from design to code. You then build them one at a time; each STEP's detailed PLAN is
written when you start it.

At any point — including a brand-new chat — the next action is derivable from
`prompts/STEP-index.md` via the **next-action resolver** (`METHOD.md` §10); each session and
STEP also ends by naming it. So *"what do I do next?"* is always answerable from disk.

## Rules
- **No application code during the architecture STEP.** Output is Markdown docs + ADRs.
- **One decision/question cluster at a time.** Don't dump a wall of questions.
- **Calibrate to the local user profile** (Stage 0; root `.throughstone/local-user.md`). At
  Level 1–2, explain what you're asking and why before asking it; at any level, treat any
  sign of confusion or request to clarify — however worded — as a cue to explain plainly,
  and tell the user up front they can ask.
- **Record decisions.** Significant choices become ADRs
  (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/adr-template.md`); the current design lives in architecture docs
  (`Code/quasar-disney-mobile-docs/templates/architecture-doc-template.md`).
- **Keep the index current.** `prompts/STEP-index.md` is the source of truth for status.
